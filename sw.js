/* =============================================================================
 * Cook County Cooks — sw.js
 * THE FLOOR UNDER THE FLOOR
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DEFECT
 *   Warm the site, walk into a stockroom, reload: net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED.
 *   A Chrome error page, with the tool list — 7.5 KB of JSON that is already
 *   INLINE in the HTML — sitting uselessly on the other side of it. There was no
 *   service worker and no manifest, so the answer to "no network" was "no site".
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES, AND THE THREE RULES IT IS BUILT AROUND
 *
 *   1. IT NEVER TOUCHES A CROSS-ORIGIN REQUEST. Not the tools, not the fonts,
 *      not the live feeds. `respondWith` is not called for them at all, so they
 *      behave exactly as they did — which is the only way to keep the promise
 *      the rest of this codebase makes about staleness. Every tool is on
 *      another origin; therefore no tool can ever be served from this cache.
 *      That is not a policy that can drift, it is a property of the code.
 *
 *   2. IT NEVER FIGHTS THE FINGERPRINTER. build/fingerprint.mjs makes a changed
 *      file a changed URL, so `assets/app.<10 hex>.js` is immutable BY
 *      CONSTRUCTION: cache-first on those is not a staleness risk, it is the
 *      ideal the hashing exists to create. Everything whose URL does NOT move —
 *      index.html above all, and the un-hashed JSON — is network-first, so a
 *      deploy lands the moment the network is there.
 *
 *   3. IT PRECACHES NOTHING. A precache list would have to name hashed
 *      filenames, which means this file would need regenerating on every build
 *      by a script this agent does not own, and a list that goes out of step
 *      with the build is a self-inflicted 404. Instead the cache fills from
 *      what the page actually loads. One warm visit is all it takes, and one
 *      warm visit is exactly the precondition of the bug being fixed.
 *
 * THE ESCAPE HATCH, because a service worker that cannot be removed is a
 * liability: loading any page with `?nosw=1` unregisters this worker and
 * deletes its caches (see the registration block in index.html <head>). If this
 * file ever needs to be withdrawn, ship it as a no-op that calls
 * `self.registration.unregister()` — an empty file at this URL would leave the
 * old worker installed for ever.
 *
 * VERSIONING. CACHE carries a version. `activate` deletes every cache that is
 * not the current one, so bumping the string below is a clean sweep. Bump it
 * when the CACHING RULES change; you do not need to bump it for content, which
 * is what rules 2 and 3 are for.
