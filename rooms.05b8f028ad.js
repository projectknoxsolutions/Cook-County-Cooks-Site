   rooms.js — room composition + hotspot geometry
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Every box is expressed in PERCENT OF THE PLATE (x, y = top-left corner;
   w, h = size).  These numbers were measured off the actual 5504x3072 renders
   with a percentage grid, not guessed — see /root/ccc-build/grid.py.

   kind:
     'tool'   -> a clickable object that opens the tool full-screen
     'screen' -> a screen surface owned by assets/screens.js
     'chefs'  -> the head chef wall (owned by chefwall.js)
     'lock'   -> the freezer keypad
     'print'  -> a sheet of paper drawn onto the wall by assets/wallprint.js.
                 It becomes an ordinary .hotspot button with the printed page
                 rendered inside it, so it clicks, focuses and gates exactly
                 like a 'tool'. `rotate` (degrees) tilts the paper on the wall;
                 the button itself stays axis-aligned.
                 It names its tool with `slug` (a tool that ships in plaintext)
                 OR with `object` (a tool that does not — see the note on the
                 walk-in's sheet below). With `object` the hotspot resolves at
                 RUNTIME against whatever tools exist by then, and builds
                 nothing at all until one does.
   `quad` (TL, TR, BR, BL in plate %) is supplied where the object sits on a
   wall at an angle, so the mounted screen is warped to the screen's plane
   instead of floating in front of it.

   `mode` (screens only) picks what screens.js renders on the glass:
     'title'  a title card — the tool's name, auto-fitted. For surfaces too
              small to render a readable web page at any zoom (the tablets).
     'image'  the daily promo card straight from the Daily Sales Report repo.
     'feed'   the detractor-streak board, one district per slide.
     'live'   a real iframe of the tool, rendered wide and scaled down.
     'report' the Daily Sales Report's numbers, composed natively and cycled.
              For a screen too small to iframe the deck legibly — see the note
              on the break-room television below.

       The client: "I love the TV screen but it's crooked. Also, it's still
       kind of small. I would love for it to be larger if possible since the
       information is important."

       Both were true and both were in the photograph, not the code. The room
       is now shot in symmetrical one-point perspective with the camera square
       to the back wall, so the display is a genuine rectangle:
         glass  x 35.50 → 64.46,  y 22.39 → 51.79
         left edge 29.10 tall, right edge 29.03  →  0.3% skew (was 23.3%)
         area 8.51% of frame (was 7.2%) — 18% bigger, 29% wider
       At 0.3% there is nothing to correct, so `quad` is GONE and this is a
       plain box. That matters: screens.js only applies its homography when a
       quad is present, so a flat panel now renders flat instead of being
       warped onto a plane it doesn't need. Inset ~0.5% off the traced glass so
       the mount sits inside the bezel. */

    /* THE DAILY SALES REPORT, ON THE BREAK-ROOM WALL.
       The client: "above the head chef of the week photos, I would like to have
       another tv mounted on the wall that scrolls through the daily sales report
       (all slides)." The plate was re-shot with that television added above the
       row of five frames — everything else in the room held its position, which
       is why the chef frames below are almost unchanged.
       Glass traced at x 40.54→59.83, y 11.12→30.60; inset ~0.5% to sit inside
       the bezel. Unlike the host stand's frozen promo card, this one runs the
       whole deck.

       MODE 'report', NOT 'live' — the geometry above is traced off the plate
       and is correct; an iframe of the deck at this size is not. The Daily
       Sales Report is a fixed 1920x1080 canvas that scales ITSELF by
       min(iw/1920, ih/1080), so inside a frame its type comes out at
       panelWidth/1920 of its authored size whatever virtual viewport it is
       handed — and this panel measures 297 CSS px of glass at a 1440 viewport,
       which puts the deck's store names at 4.3-6.5px. (The lever that fixed
       the two Dining boards — a narrower virtual viewport — does nothing here:
       those decks size their type in vw, this one does not.) Reaching a 12px
       floor would need a television ~75% of the plate wide, and even a re-shot
       45% one only buys 7.2px. So screens.js renders the same numbers from the
       same three files natively, sized in percent of this panel. See the
       MODE: report block in assets/screens.js §3 for the full measurement. */

       The client: "I want to post this as if it's a note hanging in the
       freezer."  So: one sheet, printed off and stuck to the steel with a
       magnet — the same drawn-paper object the Back Office uses, in the
       opposite orientation and in this room's own light.

       MEASURED off plates/freezer.01697f04b3.webp (2400x1340). The back wall is clear
       brushed steel from plate-x 55 -> 71 and plate-y 30 -> 72, with faint
       panel seams near y 44 and y 58 and a vertical seam near x 68. The box
       below is centred on that panel and clears every seam but the last by a
       wide margin. 11.2% x 26.0% of the plate's cover box is 269 x 348 plate
       px, i.e. 0.773:1 — US Letter PORTRAIT is 8.5/11 = 0.773:1, an exact
       match, so the sheet fills its box with no letterboxing. (The Back
       Office sheet is the other way up: 1.262:1, landscape.)

       LIGHT. The room's only practical is the ceiling fixture at plate-x ~60,
       plate-y 5-15 — above the sheet and very slightly to its left, since the
       sheet's centre is plate-x 63.0. So wallprint.js throws this contact
       shadow DOWN and slightly RIGHT, and keeps it tighter and harder than
       the Back Office sheet's: the fixture is close and the wall is specular
       steel, not matte navy paint.

       ⚠ NO slug AND NO label, ON PURPOSE, AND DO NOT ADD THEM.
       This tool lives behind the walk-in's lock, which means it is not in the
       deployed tree at all — it is AES-256-GCM ciphertext in
       data/freezer.sealed.52a8feb1c0.json (see build/seal-freezer.mjs and the gate note
       in app.js §2). Writing its slug, its name or its URL here would put in
       plaintext exactly the three strings the seal exists to remove, and
       build/seal-freezer.mjs's own leak check would fail the next build.

       `object` is how the sheet finds its tool instead: wallprint.js matches
       this string against the `object` field of the tools that EXIST at the
       moment it builds, which — for a sealed tool — is only ever after a
       correct code has decrypted them. While the walk-in is shut there is no
       match, so nothing is built: no button, no paper, no accessible name.
       That is also the gate. See wallprint.js §7. */

   `plates/freezer-door.833492497b.webp` is the CLOSED state of the freezer room: the
   insulated door head-on, frost around the seal, cold vapour at the floor, an
   industrial keypad on the wall to its right.  `plates/freezer.01697f04b3.webp` (the room
   plate above) is the interior it opens onto.

   Every box below is PERCENT OF THE DOOR PLATE, exactly like HOTSPOTS — x/y is
   the top-left corner, w/h the size.  freezer.js reads nothing else; there is
   not one pixel value in that module.

              stage on narrow viewports.  0.38 lifts the door clear of the
              chip drawer theme.css §17 puts across the bottom.

   ── MEASURED AGAINST THE FINAL ART ────────────────────────────────────────
   `plates/freezer-door.833492497b.webp` (2400x1340) is the real generated plate now, not
   the stand-in, and every number below was traced off its pixels rather than
   eyeballed. Method: for each candidate seam, walk the plate row by row (or
   column by column) and take the position of the strongest luminance gradient
   inside a +/-14px window, then take the mean of the run and reject outliers.
   The four leaf edges came out with a standard deviation of 0.8-2.4px across
   100+ samples each, i.e. better than 0.1% of the plate:

     leaf left seam    923.2px  38.47%   (sd 2.4 - the hinge straps nudge it)
     leaf right seam  1478.9px  61.62%   (sd 0.8)
     leaf top           144.0px 10.75%   (sd 1.7)
     leaf bottom       1250.1px 93.29%   (sd 2.3)
     frame outer L/R   28.10% / 71.52%   jamb stop L/R  35.35% / 64.65%

   THE HINGE IS ON THE LEFT, and this is observation, not inheritance: there
   are two chrome strap hinges on the leaf's left edge, at plate-Y 15% and 82%,
   each with its barrel sitting on the jamb at x 36.9-37.9% and its strap
   bolted across the leaf. The long chrome pull runs down the leaf's RIGHT side
   at x 59.2-59.8%, and the latch lever's keeper is bolted to the jamb strip at
   x 61.6-64.7% — hardware on the right, pivot on the left. So `hinge: 'left'`
   with a NEGATIVE swing stands: the leading edge is the latch edge and it
   comes out at the camera, which is what a walk-in door does.

   THE PLATE IS FRONTAL AND THE DOOR IS DEAD CENTRE, so `vanish` is the plate's
   own optical centre. The evidence: the leaf's midline is 50.05%, the jamb
   stops straddle 50.00%, the frame's outer edges straddle 49.81%, and the two
   jamb reveals either side of the leaf are 3.12% and 3.03% wide — equal to
   within a pixel and a half, which puts the camera axis at x 50.2%. Every
   horizontal in the shot (the brick band's foot at 54.9%, the floor line at
   97.0%) is flat to within 0.1% right across the frame, so there is no
   vertical convergence to read and no reason to offset the centre either way.
   vanish is therefore (50, 50) — the middle of the picture — where it used to
   be pulled to (50, 46) against a stand-in whose door sat left of centre.

   THE MAGNIFICATION STILL LANDS. `vanish` aims the projection; the SIZE of the
   leading edge at full travel is set by the leaf's width against the
   leafwrap's `perspective: 74cqw`. At swing -78 the leading edge ends up at
   z = leaf.w * sin(78) = 0.978 * leaf.w, so it magnifies by d / (d - z):

     1440x900   plate 1611.9px   leaf 374.1px   z 365.9   d 1065.6   x1.52
     1280x800   plate 1432.8px   leaf 332.6px   z 325.3   d  947.2   x1.52
     1920x1080  plate 1934.3px   leaf 448.9px   z 439.1   d 1420.8   x1.45

   which is the ~1.5x the swing curve and the through-the-doorway beat were
   authored around. The stand-in's 26%-wide leaf gave 1.63x, so the new,
   correctly narrower leaf brings it back rather than pushing it off; `swing`
   does not need re-tuning and is left at -78.

   `thickness` is the one number the art cannot show, because the slab's edge
   is hidden while the door is shut. It is derived instead: the leaf is 82.55%
   of a 1340px plate, and a walk-in leaf is about 1.98m tall, which puts the
   whole plate at 2.40m x 4.30m — and independently makes the leaf 1.00m wide,
   a standard 39" walk-in door, so the scale is consistent. A 4" insulated
   slab is 0.102m, i.e. 2.4% of the plate's width. freezer.js applies this in
   cqw rather than plate %, which at a desktop viewport is within ~10% of the
   same thing, so 2.3 is the value that draws a believable 3.5-4" edge.
   ⚠ `handle` is measured (the latch lever's centre, where the bolt lets go)
   but nothing reads it today — freezer.js drives the latch beat off the leaf
   as a whole. It is kept because it is the right place for that beat to land
   if the strain is ever localised, and because it documents the art.
