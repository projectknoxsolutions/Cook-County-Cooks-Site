/* =============================================================================
 * Cook County Cooks — assets/pocket.js
 * THE POCKET LIST  ·  what a phone gets instead of the restaurant
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The client, on the shipped site: "The mobile site just looks super rough, if
 * I'm honest." He asked about a separate m. subdomain and chose this instead:
 *
 *   "On a phone, serve a fast flat tool list. Same URL. Detected automatically."
 *   "the dropdown of the tools that people could access on their phone ...
 *    I don't necessarily need the extras."
 *
 * So: no rooms, no photography, no head-chef wall, no live boards. The tools,
 * and nothing else, on one scrolling page a rep opens on a shop floor to get to
 * a quote sheet in under two seconds.
 *
 * ── THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS UNDER ─────────────────────────────────────
 * THERE IS EXACTLY ONE TOOL LIST IN THIS CODEBASE, AND IT IS data/tools.json.
 * The reason we are not building an m-dot site is that the client edits that
 * file weekly and a second list would silently go stale. So nothing below names
 * a tool, a URL or a room: this module reads the same inline __CCC_INLINE__
 * bootstrap the cinema reads, through the same fallback fetch of the same file,
 * groups by the same ROOM_ORDER, and opens the same sealed envelope through the
 * same coldgate.js. Adding a tool to data/tools.ac8a24642f.json and rebuilding puts it on
 * the phone with no other edit. If you find yourself typing a tool's name into
 * this file, stop — you are about to build the thing we decided not to build.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SHOW, AND WHY ─────────────────────────────
 *   the room taglines   The client already had these taken off the rooms: "I
 *                       want those types of descriptions to be removed on every
 *                       page" (see the note over buildRail() in cinema.js). A
 *                       room here is a grouping label, not a place. Seven
 *                       taglines would wrap to two lines each on a 393px phone
 *                       and push the first tool 250px down the page.
 *   the blurbs, at rest 24 tools with two-line blurbs is 2,400px of scrolling;
 *                       24 names is 1,350px. The names are self-describing
 *                       ("Internet Quote Sheet"), so the blurb is dead weight
 *                       until you are searching — at which point it is the
 *                       opposite, because it is half of what the search matched
 *                       against and it is what explains a non-obvious hit. So
 *                       blurbs appear ON MATCHES ONLY. Same data, shown where
 *                       it earns its line.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ROWS ARE PLAIN LINKS IN THE SAME TAB ────────────────────────────
 * Every row is a real <a href> with a real URL, so long-press, "copy link",
 * "open in new tab" and a screen reader's link list all behave. There is no
 * target="_blank": on a phone a new tab is a tab the rep then has to find their
 * way out of, whereas a same-tab navigation makes the system Back gesture the
 * way back to the list — and iOS restores the page, search text and all, from
 * the back/forward cache.
 *
 * TOOLS OPEN INSIDE THE SITE, IN THE SAME FRAMED VIEWER THE DESKTOP USES.
 * The first cut of this file shipped rows that navigated straight out to
 * blufoxmobile.github.io, on the reasoning that the system Back gesture is a
 * better "close" than any button we could draw. The client's answer was that
 * leaving the site is the problem, not the ergonomics of coming back: "I want
 * to have these repositories baked into the site, not opening with the external
 * link." He is right, and the desktop had always behaved that way — a phone
 * doing something different was an inconsistency nobody asked for.
 *
 * overlay.js turns out to import nothing but freshurl.js and to inject its own
 * styles, so the phone can mount the identical viewer rather than growing a
 * second one. It also already delegates clicks on [data-tool] and owns the
 * `#/tool/<slug>` history entry, so a row here is the same kind of object a
 * hotspot is in the cinema, and Back still closes the tool — the gesture the
 * external-link version was written to preserve is preserved anyway.
 *
 * The href is the INTERNAL deep link, not the repository URL, so "copy link"
 * hands someone a cookcountycooks.com address that opens the tool in the site
 * rather than a bare github.io one. v15: THAT IS NOW TRUE, AND STAYS TRUE.
 * For two builds the paragraph above was the intent and restamp() was the
 * fact: it rewrote every row's href to freshUrl(data-url) — the stamped
 * repository URL — on every render, so a long-press on a phone copied the
 * repository after all. The client has since asked that reps never see where
 * the tools are hosted, so the rewrite is gone, data-url is gone with it, and
 * the stamp is minted where it has always mattered: on the viewer's frame,
 * on every open. A ⌘-click on a row opens cookcountycooks.com with the tool
 * framed — a fresh copy, because that open stamps its own frame.

     down in `bar`, visually hidden and wired with `for`, so the name survives
     the first keystroke and a screen reader announces the field on entry. The
     placeholder stays as the short visual hint it is good at being.

   * The SAME overlay the cinema mounts, with the SAME gate. It owns the
   * `#/tool/<slug>` history entry, the delegated [data-tool] click, keyboard
   * activation, focus handling and the deep link on load — so everything this
   * block used to do by hand is now one call, and a phone and a desktop cannot
   * drift apart in how a tool opens.
   *
   * canOpen is re-read on EVERY path in (click, keyboard, deep link, hash
   * sync, programmatic), which is what makes `#/tool/<a sealed slug>` typed
   * into the address bar hit the keypad instead of the tool. There is no
   * freezer DOOR on a phone — that set piece belongs to the cinema — so the
   * retry runs as soon as the code is accepted, with no whenOpen() to wait on.
   *
   * A slug this build has never heard of, while the walk-in is shut, is
   * refused exactly as a sealed one is: the keypad comes up and NEVER confirms
   * whether the slug was one of the thirteen. */

  /* A SLUG THE OVERLAY HAS NEVER HEARD OF STILL HAS TO REACH THE KEYPAD.
   * canOpen only runs for slugs that are IN the registry, and while the
   * walk-in is shut the sealed thirteen are not in it — they are ciphertext.
   * So `#/tool/<a sealed slug>` typed into the address bar falls off the end
   * of overlay.js §8 and does nothing at all, while `#/tool/<an open slug>`
   * opens a tool. That difference is itself the answer to "is this name one of
   * the thirteen?", which is the question the walk-in exists not to answer.
   *
   * This is the same job cinema.js does in watchSealedDeepLink, and it was in
   * this file too until the framed viewer replaced the hand-rolled deep-link
   * handler; it is restored here rather than left to the overlay because the
   * overlay cannot gate on a slug it does not have. An unknown slug and a
   * sealed one now behave identically: hash stripped, keypad up, and only a
   * correct code tells them apart. */
