 * Cook County Cooks
 * assets/app.js  ·  THE ROUTER
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file used to be the cinema integrator. It is now ~2 KB whose only job is
 * to answer one question — restaurant, or pocket list? — and load exactly one
 * of the two. The integrator moved to cinema.js, byte for byte.
 *
 * WHY A ROUTER AND NOT A BRANCH INSIDE THE INTEGRATOR
 *   The client, about the shipped site: "The mobile site just looks super rough,
 *   if I'm honest." Before that: "the site keeps crashing on my iPhone ... when
 *   I scroll down the site crashes and it turns into a blue screen" — WebKit
 *   killing the tab under memory pressure, with 35 MB of decoded plates and
 *   50 MB of compositor backing store resident (theme.css §17 carries the
 *   measurements).
 *
 *   A branch inside the integrator would not have helped, because a static
 *   `import` is fetched, parsed and evaluated whether or not the branch is
 *   taken. The cinema is engine + overlay + screens + chefwall + labels +
 *   wallprint + freezer: 660 KB raw, 213 KB gzipped, before a single plate. The
 *   ONLY way a phone does not pay for it is for the specifier never to be
 *   reached, which is what the dynamic import()s below are for.
 *
 *   Measured, 393x852 at DPR 3, scrolled to the walk-in:
 *     restaurant   25 requests · 1849 KB wire · 9 plates · 35.2 MB decoded
 *     pocket list   4 requests ·  343 KB wire · 0 plates ·  0.0 MB decoded
 *
 * THE DECISION IS NOT MADE HERE. It is made by the inline script in the <head>
 * of index.html, before first paint, and stamped on <html data-view>. It has to
 * be there and not here: this module is type="module", therefore deferred,
 * therefore it runs after the document has painted — a decision made here would
 * show the wrong site first and then swap it. Read that script for the
 * predicate and the reasoning; this file trusts the stamp and only recomputes
 * it if the stamp is missing (someone loading this module some other way).
 *
 * READING OLDER COMMENTS. Half this codebase says "app.js §2", "app.js's
 * PLATE_SIZES", "app.js builds the dialog". Those were all true of this file
 * and are now true of two others; rather than rewrite forty prose references
 * across seven modules, here is the single redirection:
 *      app.js §2 (the freezer gate + the keypad)  ->  coldgate.js
 *      everything else that was app.js            ->  cinema.js
 *      el() / fill() / $()                        ->  dom.js
 *      freshUrl()                                 ->  freshurl.js
 *      ROOM_ORDER                                 ->  roomorder.js (re-exported
 *                                                    by rooms.js, unchanged)
 *
 * NOTE ON THE import() FORMATTING BELOW — do not "tidy" it onto one line.
 * build/fingerprint.mjs anchors its import matcher at the start of a line
 * (`^[ \t]*import\s*\(`), deliberately, so that a static import quoted inside a
 * doc comment is not mistaken for a real dependency. A dynamic import written
 * as `const m = await import('./cinema.js')` would therefore never have its
 * specifier rewritten to the hashed filename, and the module would 404 in a
 * production build while working perfectly from a dev checkout.

/* =============================================================================
 * THE FLOOR — what the page is when a module does not arrive
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, with the reproduction.
 *   Every deploy opens a window in which one of these modules 404s. The build
 *   emits content-hashed filenames and prunes the previous build's, while
 *   index.html is served by GitHub Pages with `cache-control: max-age=600`. For
 *   up to ten minutes after a push, a browser holding the OLD index.html asks
 *   for the OLD hashed module names — which the new deploy has already deleted.
 *   Confirmed live on 2026-08-31: assets/app.js and
 *   assets/theme.2d7c2c8824.css were both 404 on cookcountycooks.com while the
 *   HTML naming them was still inside its own cache lifetime.
 *
 *   What that produced: `await load.cinema()` rejected, nothing caught it, and
 *   the page's only remaining link was "Skip to the kitchen" — pointing at an
 *   empty <main>. A rep mid-conversation with a customer had NOTHING.
 *
 * WHAT THIS RENDERS INSTEAD
 *   A plain <ul> of real <a href> — every open tool, grouped by room, in room
 *   order. No modules, no CSS beyond what already loaded, no fetch: the whole
 *   tool list is already in the document as window.__CCC_INLINE__.tools (the
 *   <head> writes it inline so the site boots off a USB stick). If even that is
 *   missing there is one honest line and a reload link.
 *
 *   The walk-in is NOT listed. Its thirteen labels are ciphertext and coldgate
 *   is one of the modules that may be the one that failed, so the floor says
 *   how many are sealed and nothing else — the same thing the pocket list's
 *   locked row says.
 *
 *   Links are stamped with the same `_ccc` cache-buster the rest of the site
 *   uses. freshUrl lives in its own module and may itself be the 404, so this
 *   inlines the two lines rather than importing anything: a floor with a
 *   dependency is not a floor.
