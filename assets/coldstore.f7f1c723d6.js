/* =============================================================================
 * Cook County Cooks — v4 "Alive"
 * assets/coldstore.js  ·  THE SEALED PAYLOAD
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The fourteen manager tools are not hidden in this site. They are not IN it.
 * What ships is a block of AES-256-GCM ciphertext — `data/freezer.sealed.ee7fb7ac8e.json`,
 * and the identical copy inlined on `window.__CCC_INLINE__.freezer`. This module
 * is the only thing that can turn it back into tools, and only with the
 * password.
 *
 * WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT BUY YOU — read this before you promise anything.
 *   IT DOES stop a sales rep reading the manager links out of View Source, out
 *     of data/tools.46eb63be76.json, out of the network tab or out of the DOM. There is no
 *     list to find and no hash to compare against — without the password the
 *     blob is indistinguishable from noise, and a wrong password fails GCM's
 *     authentication tag and yields nothing at all.
 *   IT DOES NOT stop anyone who HAS the password. They can read it out of this
 *     page, out of their own sessionStorage, or simply say it out loud. This is
 *     a shared secret; it is exactly as good as the discipline around it.
 *   IT DOES NOT protect the destination tools. Every one of those fourteen URLs
 *     is a public GitHub Pages site or a public Smartsheet form. Anyone who
 *     learns a URL by any route can open it. Real protection belongs on the
 *     tools themselves.
 *   IT DOES NOT hide the freezer's interior PHOTOGRAPH. `plates/freezer.01697f04b3.webp` is
 *     a static file at a guessable path and always will be.
 *
 * WHY PBKDF2 AND NOT SOMETHING BETTER
 *   Argon2id would be the right answer. WebCrypto does not ship it, and the
 *   shipped page is allowed no npm and no WASM, so PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at the
 *   current OWASP iteration count is the strongest thing available in the
 *   browser. The parameters are not hard-coded here — they are read from the
 *   envelope the build wrote, and they are AUTHENTICATED as additional data, so
 *   a tampered copy of the JSON that asks for 1,000 iterations fails to decrypt
 *   instead of quietly weakening the derivation.
 *
 * PARAMETERS ARE OWNED BY build/seal-freezer.mjs. Do not fork them here.
 *
 * Plain ES module. No build step, no npm, no framework, no external JS.
 * ========================================================================== */
