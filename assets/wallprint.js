 * Cook County Cooks — v4 "Alive"
 * assets/wallprint.js  ·  THE SHEET ON THE WALL
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The client, on the Commission Payouts tool:
 *
 *   "Move it out of the host stand and into the back office, as a graphic that
 *    looks like the HTML file was printed and hung on the wall to the left of
 *    the TV."
 *
 * So this is not a screen, not a label and not a card. It is ONE PIECE OF PAPER
 * someone ran off the office printer and taped to the navy wall — drawn, not
 * photographed, because a real printed page is what the tool IS. Drawing it
 * gives us live type at any viewport and saves re-shooting a room whose
 * square-on monitor took four attempts to get right.
 *
 * rooms.js owns where it hangs:
 *
 *     { slug:'commission-payouts', kind:'print', x:11.5, y:24.0,
 *       w:15.5, h:22.0, label:'Commission Payouts 2026', rotate:-1.4 }
 *
 * app.js dispatches `kind:'print'` here and nowhere else. Everything below is
 * composed from that box, the engine's published numbers, and the table in §2.
 *
 * ── AND THEN THE CLIENT ASKED FOR A SECOND ONE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 *   "One other quick edit. I want to post this as if it's a note hanging in the
 *    freezer."
 *
 * So there are two sheets now, and they are deliberately not the same sheet in
 * two places. The Back Office one is landscape, on warm stock, taped to navy
 * paint, lit by a pendant to its right. The walk-in's is PORTRAIT, on cool
 * stock, held to brushed steel by a magnet, lit from a ceiling fixture almost
 * directly above it, and it hangs in a room that goes eight times darker before
 * the lights come up. Every one of those is a measurement off its own plate,
 * and each one is argued where it is used:
 *
 *   the stock and the ink ......................... §1b
 *   what the note says, and where it came from .... §2b
 *   the shadow, the exposure floor, the cockle,
 *   the magnet, the document, the breakpoints ..... §5, "THE SECOND SURFACE"
 *   how it finds its tool, and why it does not
 *   exist at all while the walk-in is locked ...... §7
 *
 * That last one is the important one. The walk-in's tool is encrypted; its
 * slug, its name and its URL are not in this repository and must never be
 * written into it. Read §7 before touching anything about how this module
 * resolves a hotspot to a tool.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SHEET IS LANDSCAPE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Because the measured box says so, and the box is right. .hotspots is sized to
 * the plate's COVER box (theme.css §06), whose aspect is the plate's own
 * 2400x1340 — so 15.5% of width by 22.0% of height is 372 x 294.8 PLATE PIXELS,
 * i.e. 1.262:1. Landscape US Letter is 11/8.5 = 1.294:1. That is a 2.5% match,
 * not a coincidence: the page being printed is a wide grid of six payout
 * tables, and landscape is how anybody would actually run it off. The sheet
 * therefore fills its box rather than being letterboxed inside it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS BEHIND IT, MEASURED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * plates/office.webp has a wall CORNER — a dead-vertical seam at plate-x
 * 22.21% (traced by column-differencing the plate at fourteen heights; it moves
 * 0.17% over the full frame). The hotspot box runs 11.5 → 27.0, so 69% of the
 * sheet is on the left return wall and 31% on the back wall.
 *
 * That was checked before drawing anything, and it does NOT need the geometry
 * moved. At the plate's real exposure the seam is a soft tonal step of about
 * 5 luminance levels over ~40px, not an architectural line — there is no
 * moulding, no highlight and no hard edge for a sheet to visibly bridge. The
 * region is otherwise empty wall (std dev 6.8/8.5/11.1 per channel across the
 * whole box; mean rgb 21,21,38). What the seam DOES change is the light: over
 * the left wall the field falls off toward the corner (col means 20.0 → 14.6),
 * which is the corner's own ambient occlusion, not a directional fall. A sheet
 * standing in front of the wall is not in the corner and does not inherit it —
 * so the paper's own sheen is lit from the pendant at plate-x ~50%, i.e. up and
 * to the RIGHT, and its contact shadow is thrown down and to the LEFT. Both are
 * derived from the plate, neither is guessed.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES IT READ AS PAPER AND NOT AS A PANEL ──────────────────────────
 * 1. IT IS NOT WHITE.  #f0ece2 — a warm off-white with the room's own cast in
 *    it. Pure #fff on a photograph is the single loudest "this is a div" tell.
 * 2. IT IS NOT FLAT.  Two crossed sheens (a broad one from the pendant, a
 *    narrow cool one from the wall bounce) and a bottom-left corner that has
 *    CURLED off the wall — the paper's silhouette is clipped there, so the
 *    contact shadow follows the curl instead of squaring it off.
 * 3. IT IS HELD UP.  Two tape tabs across the top corners, translucent and
 *    overhanging the paper onto the wall, which is where the client's word
 *    "hung" actually lives.
 * 4. THE SHADOW IS A CONTACT SHADOW.  Two drop-shadows, both sized in cqw of
 *    the sheet: a tight dark one at the edge and a wide soft one thrown down
 *    and left. Sized in cqw, so it is the same shadow at 1024 and at 2560.
 * 5. IT LIGHTS WITH THE ROOM.  §4 re-derives theme.css §06b's --lit from the
 *    engine's own --enter / --bloom / --p and grades the sheet with it, so the
 *    paper is a dim grey rectangle in a room that is still "before service"
 *    and comes up to full exposure exactly as the practicals do.
 * 6. THE TYPE IS SIZED IN cqw OF THE PAPER.  Not in px, not in viewport units.
 *    A caption is a fraction of THIS SHEET at every width and every point of
 *    the push-in.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT labels.js ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * labels.js is the right module for ink on a PHOTOGRAPHED object: it fits a
 * least-squares affine to four measured corners, samples that sheet's own lit
 * paper colour off the plate, derives the ink as paper x 0.255, and fits a
 * luminance ramp over it. Every one of those four inputs is a measurement of a
 * piece of paper that exists in the photograph.
 *
 * This piece of paper does not exist in the photograph. There is no quad to
 * fit (the sheet is frontal, with rooms.js's own 1.4 degrees of "taped up
 * slightly crooked"), no paper colour to sample (we are choosing it), and no
 * ramp to measure (the wall's ramp is the corner's, and the sheet is not in the
 * corner). What is more, labels.js prints a NAME — two or three words solved to
 * fill a writing area — and this is a DOCUMENT: a title, a rule, six tables and
 * a footer, which is a layout problem and not a type-fitting one.
 *
 * So the module is its own, and it keeps labels.js's ideas rather than its
 * code, deliberately and item for item:
 *   · ink is paper x a reflectance (0.255, labels.js §3's own constant), so the
 *     ink is a warm dark grey that came from the paper and never from a palette;
 *   · type is sized in cqw of the sheet, never in viewport units;
 *   · the arrival gate is the engine's numbers, with no rAF and no timer;
 *   · the drawing is aria-hidden and `.hotspot-label` remains the accessible
 *     name, so the tool is announced exactly once;
 *   · no mix-blend-mode (theme.css §06 forbids it and .hotspots is an isolated
 *     stacking context anyway, so it would be a no-op — see labels.js's note).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE MAY NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   · It must never write --p / --plate-scale / --plate-x / --plate-y /
 *     --enter / --bloom. It only reads them. In particular --plate-x and
 *     --plate-y are registered `<number>`: writing either with a `%` unit is
 *     rejected at parse and silently kills the parallax. This module writes
 *     neither, and nothing below interpolates them.
 *   · It must not carry a per-frame TRANSFORM. theme.css §06's contract gives
 *     that to .plate-wrap and .hotspots alone. The sheet's rotate is static.
 *   · It must not carry a blend mode.
 *   · Zero layout reads. Every number is resolved by the compositor from
 *     percentages and cqw.
 *
 * Plain ES module. No build step, no npm, no framework.

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1 · THE PAPER, AS COLOUR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PAPER is the sheet's lit colour: a warm off-white, three points down from
 * white on red and fourteen on blue, so it carries the room's tungsten without
 * going cream. INK is PAPER x INK_REFLECTANCE, which is labels.js §3's model
 * and its number — a printed mark is not a colour, it is the same paper
 * returning about a quarter of the light it was going to return anyway.
 *
 * MEASURED, at the lit end (see the report):
 *   body / title / section head  rgb(61 60 58)   9.34:1
 *   commission green             rgb(13 66 41)   9.74:1
 *   GP / kicker / stamp / footer rgb(66 64 60)    8.77:1
 * All three clear the 7:1 floor this build is held to, with margin — and the
 * margin is spent, not wasted. MEASURED OFF THE RENDERED PAGE at 2560x1440,
 * darkest painted pixel against the paper beside it: 8.13 / 7.15 / 7.05 with
 * the first pair of values, i.e. the antialiasing and §5's 0.035cqw blur cost
 * roughly 1.2 points at 10px type. The two secondary inks were darkened by
 * that much so the SHIPPED PIXELS clear 7:1, not just the stylesheet.
 * The hairlines are rules, not type, and are not held to this.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* ─── 1b · THE SECOND STOCK: THE SHEET IN THE WALK-IN ────────────────────────
 * The same model, one room over, and every number in it re-derived rather than
 * copied — because the wall it hangs on is a different wall.
 *
 * MEASURED off plates/freezer.webp over the note's own box (plate-x 57.4-68.6,
 * plate-y 36-62): mean rgb(132 162 192), std 41/35/30. That is not the Back
 * Office's near-black navy paint (mean rgb 21 21 38); it is BRIGHT, SPECULAR,
 * BLUE-CAST brushed steel under a close ceiling fixture. Three consequences,
 * all of them visible:
 *
 * 1. THE PAPER IS COOLER, NOT WARMER. Office stock is rgb(240 236 226) — three
 *    points down from white on red, fourteen on blue, i.e. tungsten. This wall
 *    has no tungsten in it. COLD_PAPER runs the other way: rgb(230 236 243),
 *    thirteen down on red and twelve on green, so the sheet picks up the room's
 *    own blue instead of contradicting it. Paper that stays warm in a walk-in
 *    is the same tell as paper that is pure white on a photograph.
 * 2. THE INK IS THE SAME MODEL, RUN TO A DIFFERENT ANSWER. paper x 0.255 —
 *    labels.js §3's reflectance, and §1's — gives rgb(59 60 62). That is the
 *    DERIVATION. It is not the shipped value; see below.
 * 3. THE EXPOSURE FLOOR IS LOWER — see §5's "THE SECOND SURFACE" block.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SHIPPED INK IS DARKER THAN THE MODEL ────────────────────────────
 * The reflectance model describes a printed MARK. What ships is a RASTERISED
 * one, and at the sizes this document actually sets — 6.3 to 9.1 CSS px — the
 * two are a long way apart, because no pixel in a 6px stem ever reaches full
 * ink coverage.
 *
 * MEASURED, darkest painted pixel against the lightest paper pixel beside it,
 * on the shipped render at 1440x900, same colour, same size, three weights:
 *
 *     rgb(59 60 62) at font-weight 500 ...... 74% ink coverage ...... 3.4:1
 *     rgb(59 60 62) at font-weight 600 ...... 83% ink coverage ...... 6.2:1
 *     rgb(59 60 62) at font-weight 700 ...... 91% ink coverage ...... 8.0:1
 *
 * i.e. WEIGHT, not colour, is the dominant term. Two things moved as a result
 * and both are deliberate: every text class on this sheet is font-weight 600 or
 * 700 (the conditions were 500 and are now 700 — see .ccc-wp__cond in §5), and
 * the inks came down from the model's rgb(59 60 62) to rgb(40 42 45).
 *
 * THE THIRD TERM IS THE SUBPIXEL PHASE, and it is the reason for the margin.
 * The same string at the same size measured 6.20:1 at 1440x900 and 8.92:1 at
 * 1024x768 with nothing changed but where the sheet landed on the pixel grid —
 * .hotspots carries --overscan-k and the plane carries rooms.js's 1.1 degrees,
 * so no glyph is ever on a whole pixel, and the plate is still scaling under
 * both as --p runs. Everything below is therefore solved to a floor of about
 * 7.5 rather than to 7.0, and verified over the whole range rather than at one
 * frame.
 *
 * AS SHIPPED — the FLOOR of 123 measurements taken off the rendered page at
 * DPR 1: five widths (2560x1440, 1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768, 1024x768) x
 * three settle points each (--p 0.10 / 0.30 / 0.55) x every class visible at
 * that step. Darkest painted pixel against the lightest paper pixel beside it,
 * with every other element on the sheet set to visibility:hidden so that no
 * neighbouring row can bleed into the crop through the plane's 1.1 degrees:
 *
 *     title      rgb(40 42 45)  13.39:1      ghead      rgb(44 46 50)  10.29:1
 *     kicker     rgb(44 46 50)  12.03:1      srcline    rgb(44 46 50)   9.43:1
 *     money      rgb(6 42 31)    8.64:1      stamp      rgb(44 46 50)   8.44:1
 *     name       rgb(40 42 45)   8.08:1      footer     rgb(40 42 45)   7.63:1
 *     deduction  rgb(46 4 4)     7.51:1      condition  rgb(44 46 50)   7.18:1
 *
 * Every class clears 7:1 on the pixels that ship, at every width tested, at
 * every point of the arrival. The hairlines are rules, not type, and are not
 * held to that floor — the same exemption §1 takes.

 *
 * It is a SUMMARY of that page, not a transcription: the source prints 41 rows
 * across six product tables plus the multi-play and accessory blocks, and this

 * rows a rep actually quotes — in the source's own order and with the source's
 * own two columns, GP then commission. What is dropped is the tail of each
 * table (IE / IE Plus / NOW / prepaid on internet; tablets, watches and BAPIS
 * on mobile; NOW TV and NOW Latino; the add-on, protection and home blocks).
 * The footer says so in as many words and points at the full sheet, and the
 * whole object is a button that opens it.

 * 4 · THE LIGHTS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * theme.css §06b's --lit is the room's "lights come up" ramp, and it is exactly
 * the number this sheet's exposure wants. It cannot be inherited: --lit, --arr,
 * --hold and --lift are all declared on `.plate-wrap`, and `.hotspots` is
 * .plate-wrap's SIBLING, so a sheet in the hotspot layer resolves --lit to its
 * registered initial-value of 1 and would sit at full exposure in a dark room.
 * That is the defect the brief names, and re-deriving the ramp from the three
 * numbers the engine actually publishes on .stage is the fix. --enter, --bloom
 * and --p all inherit down to here.
 *
 * The re-derivation is theme.css's own, term for term (§06b):
 *
 *     --wp-arr  = clamp(0, (enter - 0.90) * 11, 1)      the arrival tail
 *     --wp-hold = clamp(0, (p - 0.55) * 4, 1)           the departing room
 *     --wp-lit  = clamp(0, 0.52*arr + 0.48*bloom³ + hold, 1)
 *
 * and the exposure is then 0.30 + 0.70 x that. 0.30 is not arbitrary: the
 * office's dark plate is 0.373x the luminance of its lit twin over this exact
 * box (measured, mean L 8.16 vs 21.88), and §06's grade sits at 0.68 brightness
 * at the dark end — so the wall this paper hangs on arrives at about a quarter
 * of its service brightness, and paper at 0.30 keeps the same paper-to-wall
 * ratio in the dark room that it has in the lit one (~14:1 against ~11:1).
 * Sheet and wall come up together instead of the sheet glaring out of a room
 * that has not been lit yet.
 *
 * ⚠ THREE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE TIDYING AND ARE NOT.
 *
 * 1. THE THREE PROPERTIES ARE REGISTERED. An unregistered custom property
 *    substitutes as a TOKEN STREAM, and Chromium will not evaluate a clamp()
 *    that arrives that way into the middle of another calc(): the gate resolves
 *    to 1 at every value of --enter, which looks plausible and is wrong. This
 *    is the same trap labels.js §5 documents. Registering with syntax
 *    "<number>" makes each one compute to a NUMBER at its own declaration.
 *
 * 2. NO calc() WRAPPER INSIDE THE clamp()s. Bare infix, exactly as theme.css
 *    §05's own --cut does. Same reason.
 *
 * 3. EVERY INITIAL VALUE IS THE LIT END. A page whose engine.js never ran gets
 *    --enter 1, --bloom 1, --p 0 → --wp-lit 1 → full exposure, which is
 *    theme.css §01's guarantee (2) and this file honours it.

 * 5 · STYLES — injected once, idempotent, namespaced under .ccc-wp
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The stylesheet lives here rather than in theme.css for the same reason
 * screens.js's does: this module is self-contained and must run with no theme
 * at all. Every colour, face and curve is still read through
 * `var(--ccc-…, fallback)` so theme.css §13 can dress it.
 *
 * CLASS HOOKS — this is the contract, please style through it:
 *
 *   .hotspot--print         the hotspot button, marked. It is a normal
 *                           theme.css §09 .hotspot in every other respect:
 *                           same 44px floor, same ownership gate, same
 *                           suppression in §17's narrow band.
 *   .ccc-wp                 the plane. Carries the tilt and IS the container
 *                           every size below is a fraction of.
 *   .ccc-wp__sheet          carries the contact shadow and the exposure grade.
 *   .ccc-wp__paper          the paper itself: stock colour, sheens, and the
 *                           clip that curls the bottom-left corner.
 *   .ccc-wp__tape           the two tape tabs (the landscape sheet only).
 *   .ccc-wp__magnet         the one magnet (the portrait note only).

 *   .ccc-wp--card           the landscape rate card in the Back Office
 *   .ccc-wp--cold           the portrait note in the walk-in. EVERY breakpoint
 *                           block in this file names one or the other; an
 *                           unscoped one would re-set the type on the sheet it
 *                           was not solved for.
 *   .ccc-wp-defer           the stand-in for a sheet whose tool is still
 *                           encrypted — see §7.

 *                           container queries at the foot of this sheet.
 *   --wp-paper/--wp-ink/--wp-pay/--wp-soft   the four colours
 *   --wp-lit / --wp-exp     the room's lights and this sheet's exposure (§4)
 *   --ccc-print-font        face override (defaults to --ccc-font-ui)

/* ── THE BUTTON ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   It is a theme.css §09 .hotspot and stays one — that is what buys the
   ownership gate, the 44px floor, the delegated [data-tool] click in
   overlay.js, the coarse-pointer treatment in §17 and the narrow-band
   suppression, all without a line of code here.

   THREE OVERRIDES, ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THE OBJECT IS OPAQUE PAPER:

   1. THE CLIP. §09 gates a hotspot with "clip-path: inset((1 - --live) * 50%)",
      which is inset(0) when the room owns the page — i.e. it clips hard to the
      border box. A flat button does not care. This one does: the sheet is
      rotated, its tape overhangs, and its contact shadow is thrown outside the
      box on purpose, and all three would be sheared off at the box edge. So it
      takes theme.css §05's --cut-clip instead — inset(-24px) while the room
      owns the page, inset(50%) when it does not, which is the same binary gate
      by the same number, with room for the paper. This is the identical
      substitution screens.js makes on .ccc-scr__hit, for the identical reason.
   2. THE RESTING FILL. §09's inset hairline ring and amber centre glint are
      drawn UNDER an opaque sheet, where the ring lands as a stray line along
      the paper's edge (and at a different angle, because the paper is tilted).
      Both come off.
   3. THE RETICLE MOVES OUTBOARD. The four brass corner brackets are the site's
      "this is clickable" language and they stay — but at inset 0 they print ON
      the page, which is the one thing this sheet must never look like. At -7px
      they frame it instead, which is also what a bracket is for.            */

/* ── THE CONTACT SHADOW, AND THE EXPOSURE ──────────────────────────────────
   Two shadows, because one is a blob and two is a contact: a tight, dark, almost
   un-offset one that pins the paper's edge to the wall, and a wide soft one
   thrown DOWN AND LEFT — away from the pendant at plate-x ~50%, which is the
   only real light above this wall. Both are in cqw of the sheet, so the same
   shadow renders at 1024 and at 2560 instead of a 4px shadow that is a third of
   a millimetre on one and a centimetre on the other.

   The grade is §4's. brightness carries the exposure; saturate keeps the paper
   from holding its warmth in a room that has not been lit, because an unlit
   surface loses chroma before it loses luminance. The filter is on THIS
   element and the clip is on .ccc-wp__paper below it — that order matters:
   clip-path is applied after filters, so a clip on the same element would cut
   the shadow off at the very corner the curl exists to soften. */

/* ── THE PAPER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE CURL. The bottom-left corner has lifted off the wall, so the sheet's
   SILHOUETTE is cut there — from 90.5% down the left edge to 19% along the
   bottom. Because the clip is on the paper and the shadow is on its parent, the
   shadow follows that cut: it pools under the diagonal instead of squaring the
   corner off, which is the whole reason the object stops reading as a
   rectangle. ::after then lays a soft dark wedge along the inside of the cut —
   paper bending away from the light loses it.

   THE TWO SHEENS. A broad one from the top right (the pendant), and a narrow
   cool one up the left edge (bounce off the navy return wall). Neither is more
   than 6% — a sheen you can see as a gradient is a gradient, not a sheen. */

   THE SECOND SURFACE  ·  .ccc-wp--cold  ·  THE NOTE IN THE WALK-IN
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Everything above this line is the Back Office sheet and is unchanged by it.
   The two surfaces share the plane, the shadow host, the paper host, the head
   and the footer; they share NOTHING below that, because they are not the same
   object. One is a landscape rate card someone ran off the office printer onto
   warm stock and taped to navy paint. This is a portrait note on cool stock,
   held to specular steel with a magnet, in a room that is 8x darker before the
   lights come up.

   THE TWO MODIFIERS. ".ccc-wp--card" and ".ccc-wp--cold" are on the PLANE, and
   every breakpoint block in this file now names one of them. That is not
   decoration either: the queries above were solved for a 1.262:1 sheet with two
   table columns in it, and an unscoped ".ccc-wp__paper { --wp-k: 1.42 }" would
   have re-set the type on a portrait document that has no columns to drop.

   ── WHY THE BOX IS PORTRAIT, AND WHY IT FILLS ──────────────────────────────
   Same argument as the landscape one, run the other way. .hotspots is the
   plate's COVER box (theme.css §06), so rooms.js's 11.2% x 26.0% is 268.8 x
   348.4 PLATE PIXELS — 0.7716:1. US Letter portrait is 8.5/11 = 0.7727:1. That
   is a 0.14% match. The sheet fills its box; there is no fit to solve.

   ── THE LIGHT, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The room's only practical is the ceiling fixture at plate-x ~60, plate-y
   5-15. The sheet's box runs 57.4 -> 68.6, so its centre is plate-x 63.0 and
   the fixture is 3 points to its LEFT and well above it. The contact shadow
   therefore falls DOWN and slightly RIGHT — the mirror of the office sheet,
   which is lit from a pendant at plate-x ~50 and throws down and LEFT.

   And it is TIGHTER AND HARDER than that one, for two reasons that are both in
   the photograph. The fixture is close (a shadow's penumbra grows with the
   angular size of the source over the distance to the receiver, and this source
   is one ceiling panel two metres up, not a room full of bounce), and the wall
   is polished stainless rather than matte paint — measured std dev over the
   note's box is 41/35/30 per channel against the office wall's 6.8/8.5/11.1,
   i.e. this surface has structure and specular roll-off and does not wash a
   shadow out. So the wide lobe comes in from 1.6cqw / 2.1cqw / 2.6cqw to
   0.5 / 1.25 / 0.95, and the tight one from 0.55cqw of blur to 0.26.

   ── THE EXPOSURE FLOOR, RE-DERIVED (§4's number is the office's) ───────────
   §4's --wp-exp is "0.30 + 0.70 x --wp-lit", and the 0.30 was solved from the
   BACK OFFICE's dark plate being 0.373x the luminance of its lit twin. This
   room is not that room. MEASURED over this sheet's own box, relative
   luminance of plates/freezer-dark.webp against plates/freezer.webp: 0.0430 vs
   0.3455, i.e. 0.1245x — the walk-in goes far darker than the office does,
   which is the whole reason its reveal reads as a reveal.

   Keeping the paper's fall in step with the wall's means matching the office's
   own ratio between them: f^2.2 / r held constant, with f the brightness the
   paper takes at the dark end and r the wall's luminance ratio.

       office:   0.30^2.2 / 0.373  =  0.0703 / 0.373  =  0.1885
       walk-in:  f^2.2 = 0.1885 x 0.1245 = 0.02347   ->   f = 0.1816

   Rounded to 0.20, which is the same paper-to-wall relationship the Back Office
   sheet has and NOT a paler copy of its number. A sheet at 0.30 in here is a
   white rectangle glowing on a wall that has not been lit yet.

   (In practice the note is inserted the moment the door finishes opening, with
   the room already at --enter 1 / --bloom 1, so the floor is what you see when
   you scroll AWAY and back — which is exactly when it matters.)          */

/* ── THE PAPER, IN A WALK-IN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE COCKLE. Paper in a cold room with a compressor cycling on it does not
   stay flat — it takes up moisture along the free edges and waves. That is one
   clip-path and two very soft bands, and neither is allowed to read as a
   gradient: the bands are 3.5% and 2.5%, i.e. under the 6% ceiling the office
   sheen works to.

   THE SILHOUETTE. Held at the top by ONE magnet, so the sheet's free corner is
   the bottom RIGHT — the far side from the fixture, and the mirror of the
   office sheet's bottom-left curl. The bottom edge itself bows very slightly
   (the 98.8% mid-point), which is the cockle showing in the outline rather than
   only in the shading. The clip is on the paper and the shadow is on its
   parent, exactly as above, so the contact shadow follows the cut.

   THE SHEENS run the other way too: the broad one comes from the TOP LEFT
   (fixture at plate-x 60 against a sheet centred at 63) and the narrow cool one
   licks the RIGHT edge, which is the steel's own specular bounce.           */

/* ── THE MAGNET ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Tape does not stick to a cold, wet, stainless wall, and everybody who has
   ever worked a walk-in knows it. A magnet does. So the office sheet's two
   tabs become ONE disc at the top centre — which is also what makes the 1.1
   degrees rooms.js gives this sheet read as a note that has swung a little on
   its one fixing, instead of as a rectangle that was hung crooked.

   Same reasoning as the tape: it is a SIBLING of .ccc-wp__sheet, not a child,
   so it stays out of the sheet's contact shadow (which is the shadow of paper
   standing off a wall, and wrong for a 4mm disc lying on it) and carries its
   own tight one instead. It takes the same brightness(--wp-exp), so it comes up
   with the room. Graphite rather than brass: brass is this site's "you can
   click this" colour and theme.css §09's reticle is already using it 7px
   outboard — a second brass object on the same 40 pixels would read as UI. */

/* ── WHEN THIS PAPER GETS SMALL ────────────────────────────────────────────
   Read §5's note on the landscape sheet first — the mechanism, the reason the
   queries are anonymous, and the ⚠ about LAYOUT pixels versus the pixels you
   measure on screen all apply here unchanged. Only the numbers are this
   sheet's own, because this sheet is a different shape.

   MEASURED on the shipped build. The first pair is the bounding rect on screen
   across --p 0.10 to 0.55 (the plate is still dollying under the sheet, so it
   is a range and not a number); the last figure is what the container query
   actually sees, which is the plane's LAYOUT width — smaller, because .hotspots
   is scaled by --overscan-k and the plane is rotated on top of that:
       2560x1440             326-344 x 418-441   -> 289px   --wp-k 1
       1920x1080             244-258 x 313-331   -> 217px   --wp-k 1.18
       1600x900 / 1440x900   204-214 x 261-275   -> 181px   --wp-k 1.44
       1366x768 / 1024x768   174-183 x 223-235   -> 154px   --wp-k 1.72

   A portrait sheet answers "the paper got small" differently from a landscape
   one: the card had a second COLUMN to drop, and this has none. What it has is
   a stack, so it sheds from the BOTTOM — first the provenance block (which is
   where the numbers came from, not what they pay), then the two rows §2b marks
   "opt", then the head's eyebrow, then the condition lines. The eight things
   the estimate is actually made of are the last to go, and they never do.

   MEASURED at each step, page height used against page height available, with
   a 33-character heading standing in for the runtime one (long enough to set on
   one line down to 181px of container and on two below that): 274/274 at 289,
   210/210 at 217, 160/160 at 181, 170/176 at 154 — no overflow at any of them,
   and the footer clear of the curl at all four.

   ⚠ The heading is NOT in this file and cannot be — it is the decrypted tool's
   own label, arriving at render time (§7). So every figure above has to hold
   for a heading this module has never seen: the title wraps rather than
   truncates, and .ccc-wp__doc's overflow:hidden is what guarantees that a
   longer one can only ever cost a row off the foot of the page. */

     closes back up to all eight. What was dropped at 195 was dropped to buy room
     for the conditions; with the conditions gone it fits again.

   The sheet is a fixed fraction of the plate's COVER box, and that box is
   max(100cqw, 100svh x 1.791) x --overscan-k — so how many CSS pixels of paper
   there are is decided by the viewport's HEIGHT at least as often as by its
   width. MEASURED, bounding rect at --p 0.30: 440 x 348 at 2560x1440,
   331 x 262 at 1920x1080, 276 x 219 at BOTH 1600x900 and 1440x900,
   237 x 188 at BOTH 1366x768 and 1024x768.

   Which is exactly why these queries are NOT on the stage. A stage-width query
   put 1366x768 and 1024x768 — the same 235px of paper — two steps apart and
   overflowed the smaller one by 49px. The queries below are anonymous, so they
   resolve against the nearest container, which is .ccc-wp: the sheet asks how
   many pixels of ITSELF there are and answers in its own terms.

   ⚠ THE THRESHOLDS ARE LAYOUT PIXELS, NOT THE PIXELS YOU MEASURE ON SCREEN.
   .hotspots is scaled by --overscan-k (1.10 by default, 1.06 at one breakpoint,
   1 under reduced motion), and a container query resolves against the element's
   LAYOUT size, before any ancestor transform. So the sheet whose bounding rect
   is 330px wide is a 300px container, and 275 is 250. 288 and 232 are set in
   that space; do not "correct" them to the on-screen figures.

   A document that fits at 440 is grey mush at 235, and the answer a printer
   would give is not "set it smaller" — it is "print less of it". So the
   optional rows come off first, then the optional blocks, and what survives
   takes the room back. That is labels.js §5's argument applied to a table.

   theme.css §17 removes the object hotspots entirely below 900px and on any
   viewport narrower than 8:7, and this sheet is a ".hotspots > .hotspot", so it
   goes with them — the same handoff to the rail's full-width tap list that the
   printer, the two clipboards and the recipe cards already make. That is the
   right answer and not a limitation: at 390px the whole plate is 24% of its
   width and this sheet would be 68 pixels of paper. */

/* ── THE ROOM'S OWN CROP, AND THE ONE DESKTOP SHAPE WHERE IT REACHES US ────
   This is a MEDIA query and everything above it is a container query, and the
   difference is the point: what follows is not about how big the sheet is, it
   is about which part of the PHOTOGRAPH is on screen.

   theme.css §06 sizes .hotspots to the plate's cover box and §06d gives the
   Back Office --art-x .5, so at aspects below the plate's own 1.791 the frame
   throws away (1 - aspect / (1.791 x --overscan-k)) of the plate's width, half
   off each side. With --overscan-k 1.10 that makes the left-most visible plate
   column 50 x (1 - aspect / 1.9701), and this sheet's left edge is at plate-x
   11.5 — so the sheet starts leaving the frame at

       50 x (1 - aspect / 1.9701) > 11.5   →   aspect < 1.517

   MEASURED, at --p 0.30, against the shipped plate:
       1024x768   aspect 1.333   sheet 71.4% on screen   (x = -67.7)
       1366x768   aspect 1.779   sheet  100% on screen
       1440x900   aspect 1.600   sheet  100% on screen
       1600x900 / 1920x1080 / 2560x1440   aspect 1.778   100%
   i.e. exactly one common desktop shape, the 4:3 iPad in landscape, and the
   threshold predicts it.

   THIS IS THE ROOM'S COMPOSITION, NOT THIS MODULE'S, and rooms.js's geometry is
   measured and not ours to move. The same crop treats the room's other four
   objects far worse: 'fall-off' sits at plate-x 91.5-97.5, and by the same
   algebra its right edge is outside the frame at every aspect below 1.872 —
   which includes 1920x1080. The site has always shipped that.

   What this module CAN do is decide which part of its own paper the printing
   lands on. Below the threshold it sets the page to ONE column, in the right
   66% — past the 28.6cqw the crop takes — so the surviving frame carries a
   complete, aligned, readable table with its title over it, instead of two
   tables with their product names sheared off at the frame edge. A printer
   setting a page for a narrow window does exactly this. What survives is the
   Internet table, which is the one a rep quotes first, and the footer still
   says the sheet is an excerpt and the button still opens the whole tool.   */

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 7 · buildWallPrint  ·  THE SEAM
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * app.js's buildHotspot() dispatches here on `kind:'print'` and nowhere else.
 * What comes back is a real <button data-tool> — the same element every other
 * object hotspot in the building is, so overlay.js's delegated click handler,
 * its `#/tool/<slug>` deep link, its gate and its focus restore all apply with
 * nothing added; the sheet is a decoration inside it. Keeping the drawing INSIDE
 * the button rather than beside it is what guarantees the client's "clickable
 * the whole time the room is on screen": there is exactly one hit target, it is
 * the paper, and it opens the moment theme.css §05's --cut leaves zero — which
 * is roughly 740px of scroll BEFORE the room reaches its arrival position, and
 * it stays open for the whole of the room's runway.
 *
 * ── HOW A SHEET FINDS ITS TOOL, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO WAYS ─────────────────
 * The Back Office sheet names its tool with a SLUG, because that tool ships in
 * data/tools.json in plaintext and always has. Resolution for it is a Map read
 * and it is unchanged, down to the label fallback order.
 *
 * The walk-in's note cannot do that. Its tool is one of the fourteen behind the
 * freezer's lock, and the whole point of that lock (app.js §2,
 * build/seal-freezer.mjs) is that the slug, the name and the URL ARE NOT IN THE
 * DEPLOYED TREE — they are AES-256-GCM ciphertext, and the sealing script fails
 * the build if any of the three survives into index.html or the envelope. A
 * `slug:'…'` in rooms.js would put all the effort back on the floor.
 *
 * So that hotspot names an OBJECT instead — the same `object` field every tool
 * in the index already carries ("clipboard-1", "recipe-card-2", "wall-print"),
 * which is a description of a thing in a photograph and not a key to anything.
 * The sheet then resolves LATE, against whatever tools exist by the time it is
 * asked:
 *
 *     spot.slug    -> data.bySlug.get(slug)                  the office sheet
 *     spot.object  -> data.tools.find(t => t.object === …)   the walk-in note
 *
 * ── AND THAT IS ALSO THE LOCK ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * While the walk-in is shut there is no such tool. app.js's index literally
 * does not contain it — `data.tools` holds the 23 plaintext tools and nothing
 * else until ADOPT_COLD() folds in a decrypted payload. So the find() returns
 * nothing, and THIS FUNCTION BUILDS NOTHING: no button, no data-tool, no
 * accessible name, no paper, no reticle. What goes into the hotspot layer is an
 * empty `hidden` span, which is neither painted, hit-tested, announced, nor
 * focusable.
 *
 * That is deliberately the SAME predicate the rest of the room gates on, not a
 * second one that could drift out of step with it. app.js's rail chips ask
 * `isFreezerUnlocked()`, which is `COLD !== null` — and ADOPT_COLD(), the only
 * thing that can put a tool into `data.tools`, is called from exactly one place:
 * markFreezerUnlocked(), the function that sets COLD. One state, two readings of
 * it. There is no arrangement of this page in which the note is drawn and
 * isFreezerUnlocked() is false.
 *
 * It also means the note cannot be summoned by a URL. A `#/tool/<slug>` deep
 * link is answered by overlay.js's openTool() and app.js's watchSealedDeepLink()
 * — neither of which can reach this module — and the only thing that could make
 * this sheet appear is a decrypted payload, which needs the code.
 *
 * ── THE REVEAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * revealWallPrints() re-resolves every deferred sheet and swaps it in place.
 * app.js calls it from playUnlockBeat(), beside revealFreezerInterior() — i.e.
 * as the door finishes opening and the room is handed over, the same beat the
 * fourteen rail chips ripple in on. Not at markFreezerUnlocked(): the code is
 * accepted about two seconds before the doorway clears, and a note that pops
 * into existence behind a door that is still swinging is a note you watched
 * appear.
 *
 * A session that was ALREADY unlocked never gets here at all — app.js restores
 * the payload before buildKitchen() runs, so the find() succeeds first time and
 * the note is simply part of the room, which is also how freezer.js treats the
 * door in that case.
 *
 * @param {object} spot  the rooms.js hotspot: x/y/w/h in plate %, rotate, and
 *                       either `slug` + `label` or `object`
