 * Cook County Cooks — assets/coldgate.js
 * THE WALK-IN'S LOCK — ONE IMPLEMENTATION, BOTH FRONT ENDS
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is §2 of the cinema integrator, lifted out whole and unchanged in
 * behaviour. It moved because the site now has two front ends — the walk-through
 * and the pocket list a phone gets — and the lock is the one thing neither of
 * them may re-implement. A second keypad is a second place to get the crypto,
 * the session restore, the focus trap or the "wrong code" wording wrong.
 *
 * The cinema imports it. The pocket list imports it. coldstore.js does the
 * actual AES-256-GCM work for both, exactly as before.
 *
 * WHAT THE CINEMA STILL OWNS AND THIS FILE DOES NOT:
 *   · the walk-in DOOR (freezer.js) — the set piece that swings open
 *   · the unlock beat, the chips rippling, the rail
 *   · overlay.js's canOpen / onRefused wiring
 * Those are cinema. This file is the lock.
 *
 * The keypad mounts into #modal-root, which index.html declares and both front
 * ends keep. Its look is theme.css §15, unchanged.

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 2 · THE FREEZER GATE — NOW A LOCK, NOT A NOTICE
 *
 * v3 shipped a courtesy gate: the fourteen manager tools were in tools.json and
 * in the inline bootstrap, and the "lock" was a POST to an endpoint that did not
 * exist yet and therefore unlocked on 404. Anyone could read the fourteen URLs
 * out of View Source. The client's brief is the opposite of that:
 *
 *   "I don't want the other employees to have access to what's behind the
 *    freezer door as these tools are specifically for the managers."
 *
 * This is a static site on GitHub Pages. There is no server to ask, so the
 * answer cannot be "check with the server" — it has to be that THE DATA IS NOT
 * THERE. The fourteen ship as one AES-256-GCM blob (see coldstore.js and
 * build/seal-freezer.mjs); the password is the key. Typing it decrypts the list
 * in memory. Typing something else fails GCM's authentication tag and produces
 * nothing — no partial list, no hash to compare against, no oracle beyond
 * "that did not decrypt".
 *
 * THE CONTRACT, in full:
 *
 *   sealed    the envelope from window.__CCC_INLINE__.freezer, or a fetch of
 *             data/freezer.sealed.json. Public. Meaningless without the key.
 *   unlocked  ⇔  COLD !== null  — i.e. we are HOLDING the decrypted tools.
 *             Restored at boot from sessionStorage['c3f-cold'] when
 *             sessionStorage['c3f-unlocked'] === '1', so a reload inside the
 *             same session stays unlocked exactly as it did before.
 *   unlock    ⇔  the code decrypts the envelope. No network. No endpoint.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED FROM THE v3 CONTRACT, ON PURPOSE:
 *   · /api/freezer-unlock is gone. There is nothing to POST to and nothing that
 *     could answer 404-means-yes.
 *   · The `c3f=` cookie is still READ, but it can no longer unlock on its own:
 *     a cookie is not a key, and without the key there is nothing to show. It
 *     now means "this session unlocked once", and the payload beside it is what
 *     actually opens the room. A cookie with no payload re-prompts, which is
 *     the honest outcome.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROTECTS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT — the same honest list as
 * coldstore.js's header, because this is the file people read first:
 *   · It stops a rep reading the links out of the page. There is no list.
 *   · It does not stop someone who has the password from sharing it.
 *   · It does not protect the destination tools — every one of those URLs is a
 *     public GitHub Pages site or a public Smartsheet form.
 *   · It does not hide plates/freezer.01697f04b3.webp, the interior photograph, which is a
 *     static file at a guessable path.
