/* =============================================================================
 * Cook County Cooks — v4 "Alive"
 * assets/screens.js  ·  the room screens
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module owns every screen, monitor, TV and tablet in the restaurant. It
 * takes that job over from the second half of overlay.js, which now owns only
 * the full-screen tool viewer (openTool / closeTool). The two still meet in one
 * place and one place only: every screen's hit target carries `data-tool`, so
 * overlay.js's delegated handler opens the tool — which means the freezer gate,
 * the deep-link router and the focus-return all keep working untouched.
 *
 * FIVE MODES. A screen declares one with `data-screen-mode`:
 *
 *   title  the three Pass tablets. Too small to render a web page at any zoom,
 *          so they render the ONE thing that matters — the tool's name, set in
 *          the site's display face and auto-fitted to the glass — plus a quiet
 *          "Tap to open". Live glass, not a label: glow, scanlines, a refresh
 *          shimmer and a CRT power-on that rides the engine.
 *
 *   image  the Host Stand TV. The daily promo card straight out of the Daily
 *          Sales Report's own data directory, cache-busted in the same 10-minute
 *          buckets the source app uses. Held frozen — no rotation. Fitted with a
 *          blurred same-image backdrop so a 1.40 card in a 1.52 screen goes edge
 *          to edge instead of sitting in two black bars.
 *
 *   feed   the Back Office monitor. `nps-detractor-streaks.json`, rendered as a
 *          rotating board, ONE DISTRICT PER SLIDE, big numerals, 30-day goal
 *          meters, and real celebration for a met goal or a new personal record.
 *
 *   live   the two Dining boards. Real iframes of the Win the Weekend decks,
 *          rendered into a virtual viewport and scaled down. The decks are
 *          FLUID, so the number that decides everything is that viewport's
 *          HEIGHT: tall enough for the deck's tallest slide or the slide is
 *          cut off, no taller than that or the scale factor — and with it
 *          every glyph on the glass — is smaller than it needs to be. Each
 *          board runs at its own measured floor. See LIVE_MIN_VIRTUAL_H.
 *
 *   report the Break Room television. The Daily Sales Report's own numbers,
 *          composed natively for a 297px screen and cycled like a TV. It
 *          exists because that panel CANNOT iframe the deck: the deck is a
 *          fixed 1920x1080 canvas that scales itself, so its type lands at
 *          panelWidth/1920 whatever viewport it is handed — 4.3px store names
 *          on an 18.4%-of-plate television. See the MODE: report block in §3
 *          for the whole measurement.
 *
 * NARROW VIEWPORTS. Below `(max-width: 900px), (max-aspect-ratio: 8/7)` a 16:9
 * plate cover-cropped into a 3:4 viewport throws away a third of the frame, and
 * a screen mounted in the art stops being readable. So the screens LEAVE the
 * art: each room's panels relocate into a full-width band pinned under the top
 * bar (`.ccc-scr-layer`), sized so the whole set fits above the rail. Nothing
 * about the page layout is assumed — see `narrowHost` in mountRoomScreens() and
 * the class-hook list at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * CONTRACT NOTES (SPEC.md + SPEC-v4.md)
 *   · Plain ES module, no dependencies, no build step.
 *   · No second rAF loop. Every power-on, glow and dissolve is composed in CSS
 *     from the engine's own `--enter` / `--bloom` / `--p`.
 *   · Only transform / opacity / filter animate.
 *   · Never blocks first paint; both feeds fail soft to a branded holding card.
 *   · prefers-reduced-motion: no shimmer, no scanline travel, no slide
 *     animation — the feed still advances, plainly.
 *
 * EXPORTS
 *   mountScreen(cfg)            -> handle { destroy, refresh, host, slug, mode }

const LIVE_RENDER_WIDTH = 960;

/** ⚠ THE ONE NUMBER THE DINING BOARDS TURN ON.
 *
 *  A `live` panel renders its deck into a virtual viewport and scales that
 *  uniformly into the glass. The viewport takes the PANEL'S OWN ASPECT — width
 *  `round(H * aspect)`, height `H` — so the scaled frame covers the glass
 *  corner to corner with no bars and no crop. That has never been the bug.
 *
 *  What the number decides is SIZE. Both Win-the-Weekend decks are FLUID, not
 *  fixed-canvas: `.s{min-height:100vh; display:flex; justify-content:safe
 *  center; overflow-y:auto}`, one slide at a time on their own 7s timer, laid
 *  out against whatever viewport they are handed and cut by the body when it
 *  does not fit. So `H` is a two-sided constraint: too small and slides are
 *  cut off (the client, twice); too large and the scale factor `panelW / vw`
 *  is smaller than it needs to be and every glyph on the glass shrinks with it
 *  (the client, once he saw 960).
 *
 *  ── WHY THE BOARDS LOOK EMPTY, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION ─────────────
 *  Most of the black on a Top-5 board is the DECK'S own margin, not our scale.
 *  Measured at the 1703x960 the boards shipped at: `.t5{max-width:900px;
 *  margin:0 auto}` puts that card in 900 of 1703px, so 47% of the glass width
 *  is the deck centring itself; `justify-content:safe center` then centres its
 *  656px of content in 960px and spends another 32% of the height. The widest
 *  thing either deck ever draws is `.dg{max-width:1400px}`. None of that is
 *  reachable from here: the crop would have to be uniform, and HEIGHT is
 *  already the binding dimension, so trimming width buys exactly nothing.
 *
 *  ── WHY NOT JUST HAND THEM A NARROW VIEWPORT ──────────────────────────────
 *  Because their type is `clamp(min_rem, k*vw, max_rem)` and at any width at
 *  or above ~1010px every vw-driven size is already pinned at its MAX cap —
 *  `.hd h2` 3.8rem/60.8px, `.t5p` 2.6rem/41.6px, `.t5v` 2.4rem/38.4px, `.t5nm`
 *  2.2rem/35.2px — measured identical at vw 1300, 1500, 1703 and 2200. The
 *  knee where narrowing would start to pay is at vw ~1010 and we can never
 *  reach it: below vw 1300 the store-rankings table is cut off SIDEWAYS inside
 *  `.tw{overflow:auto; max-width:1300px}` with its nowrap cells — measured
 *  -37px at vw 1250 and -172px at vw 1100. Height is the only lever there is.
 *
 *  ── THE CURVE, MEASURED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Each deck driven slide by slide at `round(aspect*H) x H`, with its own row
 *  animations parked at their end state first — the decks start their rows on
 *  a translateY, so an unsettled scrollHeight over-reports by 20-40px and an
 *  unsettled rect under-reports the NPS boards, which self-fit — and a slide
 *  counted as cut when any painted or text box lands outside the viewport or
 *  outside a scroll-clipping ancestor:
 *
 *      H     vw(chi)  Chicago (17)        vw(bs)  Big South (18)
 *      541    960     9 cut, worst -904    956    11 cut, worst -362
 *      721   1279     1 cut, worst -728   1275     3 cut, worst -189
 *      811   1439     1 cut, worst  -43   1434     1 cut, worst  -99
 *      853   1513     0 cut               1508     1 cut, worst  -57
 *      880   1561     0 cut  ← SHIPPED    1556     1 cut, worst  -30
 *      902   1600     0 cut               1595     1 cut, worst   -8
 *      910   1614     0 cut               1609     0 cut
 *      935   1659     0 cut               1653     0 cut  ← SHIPPED
 *      960   1703     0 cut               1697     0 cut  (both, before)
 *
 *  The floor is ONE SLIDE in each deck, and it is a different slide, which is
 *  why this is per board and not one shared number. Every other slide clears
 *  its deck's floor by a mile:
 *
 *      Chicago   853  District Ranker   (next tallest: Top 5 Money Makers 721,
 *                                        the other Top 5 boards 687, Store
 *                                        Rankings 510, Top 10 NPS 488)
 *      Big South 910  Top 10 NPS        (next tallest: District Ranker 758,
 *                                        Head Chef 743, Store Rankings 718,
 *                                        the Top 5 boards 533-575)
 *
 *  Below 811 a second cliff opens: the District Ranker's
 *  `repeat(auto-fit,minmax(320px,1fr))` grid needs vw >= 1416 to keep its four
 *  districts on one row, and the aspect-locked vw falls under that at H < 799.
 *
 *  ── WHAT IS SHIPPED, AND WHAT IT COSTS ────────────────────────────────────
 *  880 and 935: each deck's measured floor plus ~3%. That is +9.1% of scale on
 *  Chicago and +2.7% on Big South against the 960 both were running at, and it
 *  spends headroom to get it — Chicago 107px down to 27px, Big South 51px to
 *  25px. 3% is the honest margin here, not a round number chosen to look safe:
 *  neither deck's growth quantum fits in ANY margin we could afford (one more
 *  metric tile row on a District Ranker card is +85px, one more NPS row is
 *  +81px), so the margin can only absorb sub-row drift — a font metric, a
 *  longer label, a border — and 960 never covered a row either.
 *
 *  The ceiling, for whoever asks next: the absolute floors 853/910 with zero
 *  margin are +12.5% and +5.6%. That is ALL the size that exists in an iframe
 *  of these decks. At 1440 it moves a Top-5 store name from 7.9 rendered CSS
 *  px to 8.9 at best. If these boards have to be legible rather than merely
 *  whole, the answer is the one the Back Office and the Break Room already
 *  took: render the numbers natively at the panel's own scale (`feed` and
 *  `report`), and stop iframing a 1400px deck into 350px of glass.
 *
 *  The Daily Sales Report is indifferent to all of this: it is a fixed
 *  1920x1080 canvas that scales itself with `Math.min(innerWidth/1920,
 *  innerHeight/1080)`, so its size on the glass is panelWidth/1920 whatever we
 *  hand it — which is exactly why the break-room television is on `report` and
 *  not here. Anything that arrives in `live` mode without a measured floor
 *  gets LIVE_MIN_VIRTUAL_H, which stays at the value both boards used to run
 *  at rather than borrowing a floor that was measured against another deck. */

/** The measured floor, per board. Keys are `rec.slug`. A board with no entry
 *  falls back to LIVE_MIN_VIRTUAL_H above. Re-measure — do not nudge — if a

 *  extra document: fit() lays each one out in a 1703x960 CSS virtual viewport
 *  and scales it down to the 346x195 band panel, so two of them are two full

 *  ever evicted either one. That is two documents' worth of memory carried
 *  through every room on the device that was running out of it.

/* ══ MODE: title — THE PASS TERMINALS ═══════════════════════════════════
   A POINT-OF-SALE TERMINAL, NOT A NAME PLATE.

   The client, on the three Pass tablets: "the graphics for the screens that we
   created to overlay the screen looks kind of weak. I want the screens to light
   up and look like an actual POS system in the restaurant, just with our links
   as something we can click on the page."

   The card he was looking at was a name set on a lifted slate rectangle. It was
   lit — that part was solved earlier and is kept — but a lit rectangle with a
   word on it is a SIGN. Nobody has ever walked past a till and seen a sign. The
   difference between a sign and a terminal is not decoration, it is three
   structural things, and this layout is those three things and nothing else:

     1 · CHROME. A running application owns a strip of its own screen before it
         shows you anything: which station you are standing at, and whether it
         is talking to the back office. That is the header rail — station id on
         the left, a live pip and ONLINE on the right, hairline underneath. It
         is the single strongest "this is one screen of something bigger" cue
         available, and it costs 11% of the glass.
     2 · ONE SUBJECT. A POS shows exactly one thing at a time and shows it big:
         the order, the item, the tender. Here that is the tool's name, still
         set in the site's display face and still auto-fitted to whatever the
         glass gives it after the chrome is paid for. It remains the accessible
         name and the thing you can read across the kitchen.
     3 · A PRIMARY ACTION, PRESENTED AS A KEY. Every POS puts its commit action
         in the same place — a filled, unmissable key across the foot of the
         screen. That is the brass key: bone-on-brass, a chevron at its end,
         sized past 44px wherever the glass allows. It is what turns "a screen
         with a name on it" into "a screen you are meant to press".

   WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a second design language. Every colour is the site's
   own — brass for the key and the pip, bone for the type, the same cool slate
   the lit panel already used. There is no second typeface: display for the
   subject, the UI face in small caps for the chrome, which is exactly how the
   rest of the site sets a label. Nothing here is a screenshot of somebody
   else's POS.

   WHAT KEEPS IT INSIDE THE PHOTOGRAPH. Unchanged, and deliberately so: the
   bezel rim, the sheen, the scanlines, the downward spill onto the counter and
   the CRT power-on all still ride --scr-on. They are what welds a rectangle
   into a plate. The panel is still CAPPED — the brightest pixel any glyph can
   land on is held near relative luminance 0.075 — because the name has to clear
   7:1 against its own panel. That cap is why the backlight radial is .06, why
   the key sits in the bottom row where no glyph of the name can reach it, and
   why the slate tops out at #364258 rather than the #46566f that looks better
   in isolation and measures 5.3:1.

   The treatment is on the MODE, not on the Pass, so any 'title' panel gets it —
   including the narrow-viewport band, where the same terminal is re-laid as a
   full-width strip: chrome across the top, subject and key side by side. */

/* ── THE HOLDING CARD AS A LID, NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE ─────────────────────
   THE DEFECT. On a 393x852 phone the Break Room's Daily Sales Report panel
   showed the DECK'S OWN loading screen at full panel size: a white rectangle
   with a spinner reading "Loading Sales Report..." in the middle of a dark
   restaurant. The Dining Room's Big South board did the same. The branded
   card that exists for exactly this — holdingCard(), "Tap to open this board
   full screen." — was never on screen, and it is worth being precise about
   why, because the mechanism reads as if it should have been:

     · hold() covers the boards that are RATIONED. MAX_LIVE_FRAMES is 1 on a
       phone, so two of the three live boards get the card and look right. The
       one that WINS the frame went straight to mount(), which did
       node.replaceChildren(frame) — the card was not replaced by the deck,
       it was replaced by an EMPTY iframe.
     · the frame was then held at opacity 0 until is-live, which was added on
       the iframe's load event. But load fires when the deck's own document
       and subresources are done — BEFORE it has fetched a 1.15 MB workbook
       from raw.githubusercontent.com and rendered a slide from it. Its
       #loading overlay (position:fixed, inset:0, a near-white gradient) is
       still up, and that is what faded in.

   So the card was never wrong; it was simply not in the DOM at the one moment
   it was needed. It now stays there, ON TOP of the frame, and is faded off
   only once the deck has had time to paint — see LIVE_REVEAL_MS. Two
   absolutely-positioned children of a box that already exists: no new layer
   while it is opaque, nothing animating but one opacity, and it is removed
   from the DOM when it is done. */

/* ══ MODE: report — THE BREAK-ROOM TELEVISION ════════════════════════════
   THE DAILY SALES REPORT, COMPOSED. NOT IFRAMED.

   The client: "above the head chef of the week photos, I would like to have
   another tv mounted on the wall that scrolls through the daily sales report
   (all slides)… I want the tv to be the correct size and the scrolling
   information to be the correct size."

   ⚠ WHY THIS MODE EXISTS — the arithmetic that killed 'live' on this wall.

   The break-room television is 18.4% of the plate's width (rooms.js, traced
   off the glass and not to be moved). Measured on the shipped page, the
   panel's LAYOUT box comes out

       1024 viewport   253 x 143 CSS px
       1440            297 x 167
       1920            356 x 201
       2560            475 x 268

   (the ON-SCREEN box is ~1.10x each of those again, because .hotspots carries
   --plate-scale * --overscan-k; the layout box is the smaller, safer number
   and is the one every figure in this block is quoted against).

   The Daily Sales Report is a FIXED 1920x1080 canvas that scales ITSELF by
   Math.min(innerWidth/1920, innerHeight/1080). Inside an iframe its type
   therefore lands at panelWidth/1920 of its authored size WHATEVER virtual
   viewport we hand it — the one lever the two Dining boards still have (a
   SHORTER virtual viewport, because those decks are fluid and their scale is
   panelW / (H * aspect)) does nothing at all here. At 297px of glass the
   factor is 0.155: the deck's
   28-42px store names arrive at 4.3-6.5 CSS px and its 16px table rows at
   2.5. Putting a 12px floor under the deck's smallest type needs a
   television ~75% of the plate wide. Re-shooting the room does not rescue it
   either — at 45% of plate width the store names still only reach 7.2px.

   So this panel stops being a PICTURE of the deck and becomes the deck's
   DATA, composed for a 297px screen: the same lever 'feed' already pulls for
   the Back Office, reading the same three files the deck reads.

   THE TYPE SCALE, AND WHY IT IS A CONTAINER QUERY.
   Every size on this board is a multiple of ONE unit:

       --rpt-u: max(11.2px, 3.8cqw)

   3.8% of the panel's own width, floored at 11.2px. The percentage is what
   makes the board hold its proportions from 253px of glass to 475px and into
   the narrow band with one set of numbers instead of four; the floor is what
   stops the 1024 viewport — the only width where this panel falls below
   295px — from taking the smallest label under the readability line.
   Measured computed font-size, smallest text anywhere on the board:

       1024  11.20px        1920  13.53px
       1440  11.29px        2560  18.05px

   and every card's primary subject (store name, rank, headline number) is
   1.62em of the unit — 18.1 / 18.3 / 21.9 / 29.2px. Nothing on the glass is
   smaller than the unit itself, so the unit IS the floor.

   The first --rpt-u declaration is the fallback for an engine with no
   container queries: --scr-w is the plane's measured width, which §8 writes
   on every layout anyway, so the board comes out the same size either way.

   HOW MANY ROWS is the one thing a percentage cannot decide, because it
   depends on the panel's height IN UNITS — and at 1024 the floored unit
   makes the box relatively shorter (12.8 units tall against 14.8 everywhere
   else). JS solves it in reportRows(), exactly as makeFeed() solves its
   column count from the measured glass.

   WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not the Back Office board. The office runs
   district-by-district "days since last detractor" over every store; this is
   the SALES cut — profit-goal tracking, yesterday's conversion, national
   standings — and where it touches the streak feed at all it takes a
   different slice of it (one market-wide leaderboard, top N only). */

     therefore declared on __stage, which is inside this box. */

/* ══ the phone, and the two layers a screen does not need there ═══════════
   ADDED 2026-08-28. Measured off Chromium's layer tree at 393x852 DPR 3, with
   theme.css §06e's curtain already drawn, six screen panels on the viewport:

     .ccc-scr__scan::after ... 6 composited layers, 21.2 MB of backing store
     .ccc-scr__glass ......... 6 composited layers,  9.9 MB

   __scan::after is the slow refresh bar. It is an INFINITE transform animation,
   which is an unconditional promotion — the layer exists and is backed for the
   whole session whether the sweep is visible or not, and it is inset -60% so
   the layer is 2.2x the height of the panel it decorates. On a 349px-wide phone
   panel the sweep it buys is roughly one perceptible highlight crossing a
   thumbnail every 7.5 seconds. The scanline texture on __scan itself — the
   thing that actually reads as a screen — is a static background and stays.

   __glass carries a transform of translateZ(0), which promotes it to hold a flat
   two-stop gradient and a filter that only moves when a board powers on. The
   promotion is worth having on an iPad, where the panels are large, warped onto
   a wall plane and composited against a moving photograph. In the phone band
   they are small, axis-aligned and in a static band under the plate.

   The reduced-motion block above already switches the sweep off by exactly this
   route, and has since v3; this is the same concession spent on a different
   constraint. THE CONDITION IS THE PHONE BAND (PHONE_MEDIA), not the narrow
   band — an iPad Pro portrait matches the narrow band and must not be touched
   here. Keep it identical to PHONE_MEDIA, theme.css §06b TIER 0 and §06e. */

  /* AND THE BAND OF A ROOM THAT DOES NOT OWN THE PAGE.
     .ccc-scr-layer's opacity is var(--cut), which theme.css §05 resolves to
     EXACTLY 0 for every room that is not the one the visitor is standing in —
     and --live-cut is the binary form of the same number, registered with
     initial-value 1 so this query cannot match a page without theme.css. The
     band is therefore already invisible AND already un-hittable (--cut-clip
     puts its buttons at inset(50%)) in the state this hides it in; all that is
     left to remove is the compositor layer, which an opacity of 0 does not.
     Measured: 5.7 MB of backing store per band, two bands resident at the
     worst scroll position on a phone.

     .stage is the style container (theme.css §05 names it), and this layer is
     its child, so the query resolves against the room this band belongs to. */

  /* AND THE SLIDE CAROUSELS, WHICH WERE PROMOTING THE WHOLE DECK.
     Both rotators stack every slide absolutely and cross-fade one to the next,
     and both give the resting state a translate3d(0, .4em, 0). A 3D transform is
     an unconditional promotion, so EVERY slide in the rotation carried a
     composited layer with a backing store for the whole session, not just the
     one on screen. Measured at 393x852 DPR 3, the Break Room board mid-scroll:
     NINE .ccc-scr-rpt__slide layers at 349x236, 25.4 MB of backing store, to
     show one card. It was the second largest item on the page at its worst
     scroll position, behind the plates themselves.

     The 2D form of the same offset renders identically and promotes nothing.
     The cross-fade is unaffected: a transform/opacity TRANSITION is composited
     while it runs whether or not the resting value was 3D, so the incoming and
     outgoing slide are promoted for the 0.55s they are moving and then let go —
     which is what the promotion was worth in the first place. Layer count for a
     nine-card rotation: 9 always, to at most 2 while a card is turning.

     The .is-current rule above needs no change: a transform of none is not a
     3D transform and was never promoting anything. */

 *
 * 1. THE MEMO USED TO CACHE THE FAILURE FOR THE FULL TTL. The resolved promise
 *    — `null`, from the catch — was stored in `feedCache.promise` under the same
 *    ten-minute guard as a success, and `feedCache.failed` was written but never
 *    read by anything. So the first failure poisoned every later attempt for ten
 *    minutes: a second feed panel arming, a tab returning to the foreground, a
 *    reconnected laptop, all got the memoised `null` back instantly without a
 *    request ever leaving the page. Nothing in the module called it with
 *    `force`, so in practice the board was dead for the life of the session.
 *    A SUCCESS is worth memoising for the TTL. A FAILURE is worth memoising only
 *    long enough to stop several panels stampeding the same dead URL.
 *
 * 2. THERE WAS NO DEADLINE. `fetch()` has no timeout of its own, so a connection
 *    that opened and then hung left this promise pending forever — and the feed
 *    renderer, which only paints when the promise settles, left the glass on an
 *    empty `.ccc-scr-feed__stage`: not the board, and not the holding card
 *    either. A fail-soft path that is never reached is not a fail-soft path.
 *
 * On failure this resolves to the LAST GOOD DATA when there is any, so a screen
 * that has been up all day keeps showing this morning's board through a blip
 * rather than dropping to a holding card, and only resolves `null` when there
 * has never been anything to show.

 * 5b · The sales workbook — one fetch and one parse, shared by every report
 *      screen
 *
 * The Daily Sales Report is driven from `data/Sales Report.xlsx` in its own
 * repo, parsed client-side with SheetJS. The break-room television renders the
 * same numbers natively (see the MODE: report block in §3 for why it cannot
 * iframe them), so it reads the same workbook with the same parser shapes and
 * the same vocabulary — this is meant to be the same product on a smaller
 * screen, not a lookalike.
 *
 * THE COSTS, STATED HONESTLY. This is the only thing on the site that pulls a
 * ~900KB library and a ~1.1MB workbook. Both are therefore paid ONLY when a
 * `report` panel actually arms — i.e. when the Break Room is within one and a
 * half viewports — never at boot, never for any other mode, and never twice:
 * the library is one <script> guarded by an id, and the workbook is one fetch
 * memoised for the same ten minutes the source app refreshes on.
 *
 * THE DISCIPLINE IS §5's, DELIBERATELY COPIED. Every rule that block exists to
 * enforce applies here for the same reasons:
 *   · a real deadline on the fetch, because `fetch()` has none of its own and a
 *     socket that opens and hangs is a screen that never fail-softs;
 *   · a SUCCESS is memoised for the TTL, a FAILURE only for FEED_RETRY_MS —
 *     long enough to stop a stampede, far too short to settle what the board
 *     shows for the rest of the session;
 *   · on failure resolve LAST GOOD DATA when there is any, and `null` only
 *     when there has never been anything.

 * depends on the panel's height measured in those units — and at a 1024
 * viewport the 11.2px floor under --rpt-u makes the same box relatively
 * shorter, so the same board honestly holds one row fewer.
 *
 * The two constants are the card's own chrome and one row, both in units and
 * both read straight off the CSS above:
 *   chrome 4.1u = slide padding (.72 + .5) + header rail (1.15em x 1.15 line
 *                 + .34 padding + 1px rule) + the body gap + the 2px tick
 *   row    2.5u = 1.62em name x 1.06 line + .44 padding + .34 gap
 *
 * Measured against the panel as it actually lays out:
 *   1024  143 / 11.20 = 12.8u  ->  3 rows
 *   1440  167 / 11.29 = 14.8u  ->  4 rows
 *   1920  201 / 13.53 = 14.9u  ->  4 rows
 *   2560  268 / 18.05 = 14.8u  ->  4 rows
 *   narrow band (390px viewport)  ->  6 rows

 * long, and on this page that turned out to be "essentially always": the lazy
 * gate above is an IntersectionObserver with rootMargin 150%, and the panel it
 * observes lives inside a STICKY stage that theme.css §05 pins to the viewport
 * a full --pin-lead early and releases a --pin-lead late. A pinned panel's rect
 * sits at the top of the viewport and stops moving, so the observer keeps
 * reporting it as intersecting for the whole of its room's runway and a
 * viewport and a half either side of that. Measured at 393x852: the Dining
 * boards were mounted from scrollY 591 to 7092 out of 8230 — a whole extra
 * document, laid out in a 1703x960 virtual viewport, carried through five rooms
 * that do not contain it. (The Win-the-Weekend deck is 5.6 MB of HTML.)
 *
 * theme.css §06e's curtain already knows exactly when a room is not being
 * looked at, and engine.js publishes it as one class. So on a phone a live
 * iframe additionally requires its own room to be resident. Nothing changes
 * anywhere else: `is-dormant` is only ever set by engine.js, it is set on every
 * breakpoint, and this is the only place outside theme.css §06e that reads it.
 *
 * ON AN iPAD AND A DESKTOP THIS FUNCTION IS `rec.wantsMount`, EXACTLY AS
 * BEFORE. isPhone cannot match an iPad — see PHONE_MEDIA — and a panel with no
 * room element (a standalone mount) is never gated.
 *
 * WHAT THE UNBUDGETED BOARD SHOWS IS UNCHANGED: hold() below still gives it the
 * branded holding card, still names the board, and the button over the glass is
 * still live, so "every screen readable and clickable the whole time its room

 *
 * Narrow band:
 *   .ccc-scr-layer[data-screens-layer="<room>"]  one per room, inside .stage,
 *                                                inserted before .rail
 *   .ccc-scr-layer--<room>                       per-room hook
 *   --scr-count / --scr-gap / --scr-band-h       the band's sizing knobs
 *   .stage[data-ccc-screens="narrow|wide"]       page-level hook
 *   Supply `[data-screens-narrow]` inside a room, or pass `narrowHost`, and
 *   this module puts the panels there instead of building its own band.
 *
 * Custom properties JS writes on `.ccc-scr__plane`:
 *   --scr-w --scr-h      the glass size in px, PRE-warp (unitless numbers)
 *   --scr-u              the type unit: max(9px, width / 40), or / 32 when narrow.
 *                        Every size inside a feed or holding card is an em of it.
 *   --scr-title-fs       the solved subject size for `title` mode
 *   --scr-pos-fs         the solved chrome unit for `title` mode — the rail,
 *                        the key and the chevron are all ems of it
 * and on the panel: --scr-ar (narrow aspect ratio, a plain number).
 * CSS-side, `.ccc-scr--narrow .ccc-scr__plane` defines --scr-cap-h (the caption
 * rail's height); set it to 0px to reclaim that strip for the glass.
 * The feed's grid carries --scr-cols and --scr-num (the numeral's em size),
 * both solved from the glass width and the store count.
 * The report board carries --rpt-u (its one type unit — max(11.2px, 3.8cqw),
 * with a --scr-w-derived fallback for engines without container queries) and
 * --rpt-slide (the slide clock's duration, written by JS from
 * REPORT_SLIDE_MS). Its row COUNT is solved in JS by reportRows().
 *
 * Custom properties JS READS (all from the engine, all @property-registered):
 *   --enter --bloom --p
