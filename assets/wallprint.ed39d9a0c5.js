 * Cook County Cooks — v4 "Alive"
 * assets/wallprint.js  ·  THE SHEET ON THE WALL
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The client, on the Commission Payouts tool:
 *
 *   "Move it out of the host stand and into the back office, as a graphic that
 *    looks like the HTML file was printed and hung on the wall to the left of
 *    the TV."
 *
 * So this is not a screen, not a label and not a card. It is ONE PIECE OF PAPER
 * someone ran off the office printer and taped to the navy wall — drawn, not
 * photographed, because a real printed page is what the tool IS. Drawing it
 * gives us live type at any viewport and saves re-shooting a room whose
 * square-on monitor took four attempts to get right.
 *
 * rooms.js owns where it hangs:
 *
 *     { slug:'commission-payouts', kind:'print', x:9.0, y:25.0,
 *       w:12.0, h:17.0, label:'Commission Payouts 2026', rotate:-1.4 }
 *
 * app.js dispatches `kind:'print'` here and nowhere else. Everything below is
 * composed from that box, the engine's published numbers, and the table in §2.
 *
 * ── AND THEN THE CLIENT ASKED FOR A SECOND ONE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 *   "One other quick edit. I want to post this as if it's a note hanging in the
 *    freezer."
 *
 * So there are two sheets now, and they are deliberately not the same sheet in
 * two places. The Back Office one is landscape, on warm stock, taped to navy
 * paint, lit by a pendant to its right. The walk-in's is PORTRAIT, on cool
 * stock, held to brushed steel by a magnet, lit from a ceiling fixture almost
 * directly above it, and it hangs in a room that goes eight times darker before
 * the lights come up. Every one of those is a measurement off its own plate,
 * and each one is argued where it is used:
 *
 *   the stock and the ink ......................... §1b
 *   what the note says, and where it came from .... §2b
 *   the shadow, the exposure floor, the cockle,
 *   the magnet, the document, the breakpoints ..... §5, "THE SECOND SURFACE"
 *   how it finds its tool, and why it does not
 *   exist at all while the walk-in is locked ...... §7
 *
 * That last one is the important one. The walk-in's tool is encrypted; its
 * slug, its name and its URL are not in this repository and must never be
 * written into it. Read §7 before touching anything about how this module
 * resolves a hotspot to a tool.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SHEET IS LANDSCAPE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Because the measured box says so, and the box is right. .hotspots is sized to
 * the plate's COVER box (theme.css §06), whose aspect is the plate's own
 * 2400x1340 — so 12.0% of width by 17.0% of height is 288 x 227.8 PLATE PIXELS,
 * i.e. 1.264:1. Landscape US Letter is 11/8.5 = 1.294:1. That is a 2.3% match,
 * not a coincidence: the page being printed is a wide grid of six payout
 * tables, and landscape is how anybody would actually run it off. The sheet
 * therefore fills its box rather than being letterboxed inside it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS BEHIND IT, MEASURED — AND WHY THE BOX MOVED ─────────────────────
 * plates/office.4e4c6d7172.webp has a wall CORNER — a dead-vertical seam at plate-x
 * 22.21% (re-traced for this pass by column-differencing the plate at fourteen
 * heights: 21.92 to 22.25 over the nine bands that are wall, mean 22.19, i.e.
 * it moves 0.33% over the height of the wall and the published figure holds).
 *
 * The first cut of this sheet ran 11.5 → 27.0, so 69% of it sat on the left
 * return wall and 31% on the lit back wall, and the client read exactly that:
 *
 *   "I also want to reduce the size of the Commission Report on the Back
 *    Office Page because it looks like it's taped to both walls on the screen."
 *
 * He was right. The seam is a soft tonal step rather than an architectural
 * line, which is why it was signed off the first time — but a sheet of paper
 * spanning it still reads as a page bent around a corner, because the light on
 * one side of it does not match the light on the other. rooms.js now runs the
 * box 9.0 → 21.0, ENTIRELY ON THE RETURN WALL, with 1.21% of plate width
 * between the sheet's box and the seam. MEASURED against the shipped plate,
 * the widest thing this module paints:
 *
 *     paper's own right edge, with the plane's -1.4deg  ...  plate-x 21.11
 *     the top-right tape tab, which overhangs it by 3.6cqw   plate-x 21.32
 *     the contact shadow, thrown down and LEFT                (further left)
 *
 * so the nearest painted pixel to the corner is 0.89% of the plate away from
 * it, at every viewport and at every point of the push-in (measured at 2560,
 * 1920, 1600, 1440, 1366 and 1024: max 21.114 for the box at all six).
 *
 * The wall the sheet now hangs on is FLATTER than the one it used to span:
 * mean rgb(18.9 16.6 31.8), std dev 2.9/2.5/2.2 per channel over the new box
 * against 6.8/8.5/11.1 over the old one — the old figure was carrying the
 * corner's own ambient occlusion, and this box has none of it. The paper's
 * sheen is still lit from the pendant at plate-x ~50%, i.e. up and to the
 * RIGHT, and its contact shadow is still thrown down and to the LEFT. Both are
 * derived from the plate, neither is guessed.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES IT READ AS PAPER AND NOT AS A PANEL ──────────────────────────
 * 1. IT IS NOT WHITE.  #f0ece2 — a warm off-white with the room's own cast in
 *    it. Pure #fff on a photograph is the single loudest "this is a div" tell.
 * 2. IT IS NOT FLAT.  Two crossed sheens (a broad one from the pendant, a
 *    narrow cool one from the wall bounce) and a bottom-left corner that has
 *    CURLED off the wall — the paper's silhouette is clipped there, so the
 *    contact shadow follows the curl instead of squaring it off.
 * 3. IT IS HELD UP.  Two tape tabs across the top corners, translucent and
 *    overhanging the paper onto the wall, which is where the client's word
 *    "hung" actually lives.
 * 4. THE SHADOW IS A CONTACT SHADOW.  Two drop-shadows, both sized in cqw of
 *    the sheet: a tight dark one at the edge and a wide soft one thrown down
 *    and left. Sized in cqw, so it is the same shadow at 1024 and at 2560.
 * 5. IT LIGHTS WITH THE ROOM.  §4 re-derives theme.css §06b's --lit from the
 *    engine's own --enter / --bloom / --p and grades the sheet with it, so the
 *    paper is a dim grey rectangle in a room that is still "before service"
 *    and comes up to full exposure exactly as the practicals do.
 * 6. THE TYPE IS SIZED IN cqw OF THE PAPER.  Not in px, not in viewport units.
 *    A caption is a fraction of THIS SHEET at every width and every point of
 *    the push-in.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT labels.js ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * labels.js is the right module for ink on a PHOTOGRAPHED object: it fits a
 * least-squares affine to four measured corners, samples that sheet's own lit
 * paper colour off the plate, derives the ink as paper x 0.255, and fits a
 * luminance ramp over it. Every one of those four inputs is a measurement of a
 * piece of paper that exists in the photograph.
 *
 * This piece of paper does not exist in the photograph. There is no quad to
 * fit (the sheet is frontal, with rooms.js's own 1.4 degrees of "taped up
 * slightly crooked"), no paper colour to sample (we are choosing it), and no
 * ramp to measure (the wall's ramp is the corner's, and the sheet is not in the
 * corner). What is more, labels.js prints a NAME — two or three words solved to
 * fill a writing area — and this is a DOCUMENT: a title, a rule, six tables and
 * a footer, which is a layout problem and not a type-fitting one.
 *
 * So the module is its own, and it keeps labels.js's ideas rather than its
 * code, deliberately and item for item:
 *   · ink is paper x a reflectance (0.255, labels.js §3's own constant), so the
 *     ink is a warm dark grey that came from the paper and never from a palette;
 *   · type is sized in cqw of the sheet, never in viewport units;
 *   · the arrival gate is the engine's numbers, with no rAF and no timer;
 *   · the drawing is aria-hidden and `.hotspot-label` remains the accessible
 *     name, so the tool is announced exactly once;
 *   · no mix-blend-mode (theme.css §06 forbids it and .hotspots is an isolated
 *     stacking context anyway, so it would be a no-op — see labels.js's note).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE MAY NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   · It must never write --p / --plate-scale / --plate-x / --plate-y /
 *     --enter / --bloom. It only reads them. In particular --plate-x and
 *     --plate-y are registered `<number>`: writing either with a `%` unit is
 *     rejected at parse and silently kills the parallax. This module writes
 *     neither, and nothing below interpolates them.
 *   · It must not carry a per-frame TRANSFORM. theme.css §06's contract gives
 *     that to .plate-wrap and .hotspots alone. The sheet's rotate is static.
 *   · It must not carry a blend mode.
 *   · Zero layout reads. Every number is resolved by the compositor from
 *     percentages and cqw.
 *
 * Plain ES module. No build step, no npm, no framework.

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1 · THE PAPER, AS COLOUR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PAPER is the sheet's lit colour: a warm off-white, three points down from
 * white on red and fourteen on blue, so it carries the room's tungsten without
 * going cream. The MODEL for the ink is PAPER x INK_REFLECTANCE, which is
 * labels.js §3's model and its number — a printed mark is not a colour, it is
 * the same paper returning about a quarter of the light it was going to return
 * anyway. That model gives rgb(61 60 58), and it is not what ships; the note
 * on INK_CSS below says why, and it is the same argument §1b makes for the
 * walk-in's stock.
 *
 * The floor this build is held to is 7:1, measured on the PIXELS THAT SHIP and
 * not in the stylesheet — and measured as the FLOOR of several frames rather
 * than as one reading, because the sheet is rasterised under a moving scale.
 * The as-shipped table is at the end of this section.
 * The hairlines are rules, not type, and are not held to it.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

const PAPER = [240, 236, 226];
const INK_REFLECTANCE = 0.255;

const rgb = (c) => `rgb(${c[0]} ${c[1]} ${c[2]})`;
const inkFrom = (paper) =>
  paper.map((v) => Math.round(Math.max(0, Math.min(255, v * INK_REFLECTANCE))));

const PAPER_CSS = rgb(PAPER);

/* ⚠ THE MODEL IS NOT THE SHIPPED VALUE, and §1's note above says why. What
   inkFrom(PAPER) gives is rgb(61 60 58), and that is the DERIVATION — a printed
   mark returning a quarter of the light the paper returns. What ships is
   rgb(31 31 29), which is the same mark RASTERISED at 7.8 to 8.6 CSS px on a
   surface that is then scaled 1.12 to 1.22 by .hotspots' own transform. This is
   §1b's argument, run for the second time and on the other sheet, and it only
   became necessary when rooms.js moved this one off the wall corner and took
   41% of its area with it.

   MEASURED, the FLOOR of three lit frames (--p 0.45 / 0.50 / 0.55) at each of
   1024x768, 1366x768, 1440x900, 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, darkest painted pixel
   against the lightest paper pixel beside it, with every other element on the
   sheet set to visibility:hidden so no neighbouring row can bleed into the crop
   through the plane's 1.4 degrees:

       body ink at rgb(61 60 58) ..... 4.50 : 1   the model
       body ink at rgb(42 42 40) ..... 5.48 : 1
       body ink at rgb(31 31 29) ..... 7.68 : 1   with §5's weights and stroke

   Taking the FLOOR of several frames rather than one reading is the change of
   method that matters here, and it is forced by the same subpixel phase §1b
   documents: the identical string measured 5.46:1 and 9.59:1 two frames apart
   at 1920x1080 with nothing changed but where the sheet landed on the pixel
   grid. .hotspots is scaled by --overscan-k AND by --plate-scale, which is
   still moving while the room dollies, so a single frame proves nothing.

   ⚠ WITH ARCHIVO ACTUALLY LOADED. The face comes from Google Fonts and is the
   one thing on this page that is not in the repository; measured against the
   system fallback the same table floors at 7.83, and the difference is not
   noise — Archivo is a VARIABLE face on a wdth axis, so every font-stretch on
   this sheet is a real instance rather than a no-op, and a narrower instance
   is a thinner stem. Measure with the font, or you are measuring something
   else.

   The gaps are classes that are not on the page at that width rather than
   classes that failed: the GP column is off the sheet below 216px of container
   and the eyebrow below 180px (§5's ladder), and the stamp is off it inside
   the 4:3 crop band (§5's media block). Nothing that IS printed measures under
   7.68:1 at any width at any of the three frames. Before this pass, by the
   same method, the same sheet floored at 3.37:1.

/* ─── 1b · THE SECOND STOCK: THE SHEET IN THE WALK-IN ────────────────────────
 * The same model, one room over, and every number in it re-derived rather than
 * copied — because the wall it hangs on is a different wall.
 *
 * MEASURED off plates/freezer.01697f04b3.webp over the note's own box (plate-x 57.4-68.6,
 * plate-y 36-62): mean rgb(132 162 192), std 41/35/30. That is not the Back
 * Office's near-black navy paint (mean rgb 21 21 38); it is BRIGHT, SPECULAR,
 * BLUE-CAST brushed steel under a close ceiling fixture. Three consequences,
 * all of them visible:
 *
 * 1. THE PAPER IS COOLER, NOT WARMER. Office stock is rgb(240 236 226) — three
 *    points down from white on red, fourteen on blue, i.e. tungsten. This wall
 *    has no tungsten in it. COLD_PAPER runs the other way: rgb(230 236 243),
 *    thirteen down on red and twelve on green, so the sheet picks up the room's
 *    own blue instead of contradicting it. Paper that stays warm in a walk-in
 *    is the same tell as paper that is pure white on a photograph.
 * 2. THE INK IS THE SAME MODEL, RUN TO A DIFFERENT ANSWER. paper x 0.255 —
 *    labels.js §3's reflectance, and §1's — gives rgb(59 60 62). That is the
 *    DERIVATION. It is not the shipped value; see below.
 * 3. THE EXPOSURE FLOOR IS LOWER — see §5's "THE SECOND SURFACE" block.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SHIPPED INK IS DARKER THAN THE MODEL ────────────────────────────
 * The reflectance model describes a printed MARK. What ships is a RASTERISED
 * one, and at the sizes this document actually sets — 6.3 to 9.1 CSS px — the
 * two are a long way apart, because no pixel in a 6px stem ever reaches full
 * ink coverage.
 *
 * MEASURED, darkest painted pixel against the lightest paper pixel beside it,
 * on the shipped render at 1440x900, same colour, same size, three weights:
 *
 *     rgb(59 60 62) at font-weight 500 ...... 74% ink coverage ...... 3.4:1
 *     rgb(59 60 62) at font-weight 600 ...... 83% ink coverage ...... 6.2:1
 *     rgb(59 60 62) at font-weight 700 ...... 91% ink coverage ...... 8.0:1
 *
 * i.e. WEIGHT, not colour, is the dominant term. Two things moved as a result
 * and both are deliberate: every text class on this sheet is font-weight 600 or
 * 700 (the conditions were 500 and are now 700 — see .ccc-wp__cond in §5), and
 * the inks came down from the model's rgb(59 60 62) to rgb(40 42 45).
 *
 * THE THIRD TERM IS THE SUBPIXEL PHASE, and it is the reason for the margin.
 * The same string at the same size measured 6.20:1 at 1440x900 and 8.92:1 at
 * 1024x768 with nothing changed but where the sheet landed on the pixel grid —
 * .hotspots carries --overscan-k and the plane carries rooms.js's 1.1 degrees,
 * so no glyph is ever on a whole pixel, and the plate is still scaling under
 * both as --p runs. Everything below is therefore solved to a floor of about
 * 7.5 rather than to 7.0, and verified over the whole range rather than at one
 * frame.
 *
 * AS SHIPPED — the FLOOR of 123 measurements taken off the rendered page at
 * DPR 1: five widths (2560x1440, 1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768, 1024x768) x
 * three settle points each (--p 0.10 / 0.30 / 0.55) x every class visible at
 * that step. Darkest painted pixel against the lightest paper pixel beside it,
 * with every other element on the sheet set to visibility:hidden so that no
 * neighbouring row can bleed into the crop through the plane's 1.1 degrees:
 *
 *     title      rgb(40 42 45)  13.39:1      ghead      rgb(44 46 50)  10.29:1
 *     kicker     rgb(44 46 50)  12.03:1      srcline    rgb(44 46 50)   9.43:1
 *     money      rgb(6 42 31)    8.64:1      stamp      rgb(44 46 50)   8.44:1

 *     deduction  rgb(46 4 4)     7.51:1      condition  rgb(44 46 50)   7.18:1
 *
 * Every class clears 7:1 on the pixels that ship, at every width tested, at
 * every point of the arrival. The hairlines are rules, not type, and are not
 * held to that floor — the same exemption §1 takes.

 * TWO sheets now, in two orientations, keyed by what the hotspot names itself

 * that does not (see §7). `layout` picks the renderer in §6:
 *
 *   'card'  the landscape rate card. Two columns of product tables.

 * https://blufoxmobile.github.io/Commission-Payouts/ — by fetching the page and
 * extracting its own tables. Nothing here is invented, and nothing is lorem.
 *
 * It is a SUMMARY of that page, not a transcription: the source prints 41 rows
 * across six product tables plus the multi-play and accessory blocks, and this
 * sheet is 288 x 228 plate pixels. What is kept is the top of every table — the
 * rows a rep actually quotes — in the source's own order and with the source's
 * own two columns, GP then commission. What is dropped is the tail of each
 * table (IE / IE Plus / NOW / prepaid on internet; tablets, watches and BAPIS
 * on mobile; NOW TV and NOW Latino; the add-on, protection and home blocks).
 * The footer says so in as many words and points at the full sheet, and the
 * whole object is a button that opens it.

 * If the payouts change, change them HERE and nowhere else. The renderer in §6
 * has no knowledge of what any of these numbers mean.

  /* Two columns of tables, laid out left then right.

     THREE THINGS CAN BE SHED, and they are shed from the BOTTOM of each table
     in the source's own order, so what survives is always the top of it — the
     rows a rep actually quotes:

       `opt`  on a BLOCK   the whole table goes  (Xfinity Mobile, Multi-Play)
       'opt'  on a ROW     the last row of a table goes   (300 Mbps, NOW TV)
       'opt2' on a ROW     the second-to-last goes too    (500 Mbps, TV Core)
       'opt3' on a ROW     the third-to-last goes too     (Gig, Sports & News)

     Every one of them is driven by a container query in §5, and every query
     spends what it frees on TYPE SIZE. See the ladder at the foot of §5 for
     what comes off at which width and why the trade is the right way round.

     ⚠ 'opt3' IS ALSO A CONTRAST DECISION AND NOT ONLY A SPACE ONE, and that is
     the one place the two arguments meet. "Sports & News" is the longest
     product name on the sheet by 20%, and while it is on the page it caps
     --wp-k at 1.93 (see §5's ceiling note) — which at 165px of container is
     7.96px of body type, and 7.96px of body type floors at 5.15:1. Taking that

 * 4 · THE LIGHTS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * theme.css §06b's --lit is the room's "lights come up" ramp, and it is exactly
 * the number this sheet's exposure wants. It cannot be inherited: --lit, --arr,
 * --hold and --lift are all declared on `.plate-wrap`, and `.hotspots` is
 * .plate-wrap's SIBLING, so a sheet in the hotspot layer resolves --lit to its
 * registered initial-value of 1 and would sit at full exposure in a dark room.
 * That is the defect the brief names, and re-deriving the ramp from the three
 * numbers the engine actually publishes on .stage is the fix. --enter, --bloom
 * and --p all inherit down to here.
 *
 * The re-derivation is theme.css's own, term for term (§06b):
 *
 *     --wp-arr  = clamp(0, (enter - 0.90) * 11, 1)      the arrival tail
 *     --wp-hold = clamp(0, (p - 0.55) * 4, 1)           the departing room
 *     --wp-lit  = clamp(0, 0.52*arr + 0.48*bloom³ + hold, 1)
 *
 * and the exposure is then 0.30 + 0.70 x that. 0.30 is not arbitrary: it is
 * solved from the ratio between the office's dark plate and its lit twin OVER
 * THE SHEET'S OWN BOX, and that box has moved — so the ratio was re-measured
 * for this pass rather than assumed:
 *
 *     old box, plate-x 11.5-27.0 / y 24-46 ... mean L8 8.15 vs 22.23 ... 0.366
 *     new box, plate-x  9.0-21.0 / y 25-42 ... mean L8 6.56 vs 18.17 ... 0.361
 *
 * i.e. the return wall falls off at very nearly the same rate as the pair of
 * walls the old box spanned, which is what you would expect of a room lit by
 * one pendant. Running §5's own f^2.2 / r = constant through the new number
 * gives f = 0.295 against the 0.300 that is here, so THE FLOOR STANDS TO TWO
 * DECIMALS and is left alone. §06's grade sits at 0.68 brightness at the dark
 * end, so the wall this paper hangs on arrives at about a quarter of its
 * service brightness, and paper at 0.30 keeps the same paper-to-wall ratio in
 * the dark room that it has in the lit one. Sheet and wall come up together
 * instead of the sheet glaring out of a room that has not been lit yet.
 *
 * (The published relative-luminance ratio over the same two boxes is 0.275 and
 * 0.314; the L8 figures above are the ones the original derivation used and
 * are quoted so the two are comparable.)
 *
 * ⚠ THREE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE TIDYING AND ARE NOT.
 *
 * 1. THE THREE PROPERTIES ARE REGISTERED. An unregistered custom property
 *    substitutes as a TOKEN STREAM, and Chromium will not evaluate a clamp()
 *    that arrives that way into the middle of another calc(): the gate resolves
 *    to 1 at every value of --enter, which looks plausible and is wrong. This
 *    is the same trap labels.js §5 documents. Registering with syntax
 *    "<number>" makes each one compute to a NUMBER at its own declaration.
 *
 * 2. NO calc() WRAPPER INSIDE THE clamp()s. Bare infix, exactly as theme.css
 *    §05's own --cut does. Same reason.
 *
 * 3. EVERY INITIAL VALUE IS THE LIT END. A page whose engine.js never ran gets
 *    --enter 1, --bloom 1, --p 0 → --wp-lit 1 → full exposure, which is
 *    theme.css §01's guarantee (2) and this file honours it.

 *                           suppression in §17's narrow band.
 *   .ccc-wp                 the plane. Carries the tilt and IS the container
 *                           every size below is a fraction of.
 *   .ccc-wp__sheet          carries the contact shadow and the exposure grade.

/* ── THE TWO MONEY COLUMNS, IN em OF THE ROW AND NOT IN cqw ────────────────
   REGISTERED AS <length>, and that is the whole point. A registered property
   COMPUTES AT ITS OWN DECLARATION, so "2.34em" written on .ccc-wp__paper is
   resolved there — against the paper's own font-size, which is the row font —
   and inherits down as an absolute pixel length. Both the figure and the
   column head it sits under therefore get the SAME box, even though the head
   sets at 0.68 of the row's size and an unregistered "2.34em" would resolve
   against each element's own font and hand them two different widths.

   THE BUG THIS KILLS. These two were 9.9cqw / 6.6cqw, re-solved by hand to
   7.2cqw in one breakpoint and left alone in the others — and cqw does not
   know about --wp-k. The moment the type scale moved, "$200" was 19px of
   figure in a 16.7px box: no clip on these (they are flex:0 0 auto with
   text-align:end and no overflow rule), so the digits simply painted LEFT,
   out of their box and into the product name beside them. MEASURED on the
   shipped build at 1920, 1600, 1440 and 1366: eight overflowing cells at
   every one of them, worst at "Sports & News $110" where the two strings met.
   In em they track --wp-k for nothing, at every step, for ever.

   THE NUMBERS, measured off the rendered page as multiples of the row's own
   font-size (widest string in each column, plus the head that sits over it):
       "$200"     2.222em      "GP"      1.112em   ->  --wp-gp-w  2.34em
       "+$10.50"  3.620em      "COMM"    2.390em   ->  --wp-pay-w 3.76em
   and once the Multi-Play table is off the sheet the widest payout is "$23"
   at 1.674em, so the figure box comes in to 1.85em while the HEAD's box stays
   at 2.50em — the head is justify-content:flex-end, so its right edge stays
   flush with the figures whatever its width, and "COMM" is the one string on
   the sheet that is wider than the numbers it heads. */

/* ── THE BUTTON ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   It is a theme.css §09 .hotspot and stays one — that is what buys the
   ownership gate, the 44px floor, the delegated [data-tool] click in
   overlay.js, the coarse-pointer treatment in §17 and the narrow-band
   suppression, all without a line of code here.

   THREE OVERRIDES, ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THE OBJECT IS OPAQUE PAPER:

   1. THE CLIP. §09 gates a hotspot with "clip-path: inset((1 - --live) * 50%)",
      which is inset(0) when the room owns the page — i.e. it clips hard to the
      border box. A flat button does not care. This one does: the sheet is
      rotated, its tape overhangs, and its contact shadow is thrown outside the
      box on purpose, and all three would be sheared off at the box edge. So it
      takes theme.css §05's --cut-clip instead — inset(-24px) while the room
      owns the page, inset(50%) when it does not, which is the same binary gate
      by the same number, with room for the paper. This is the identical
      substitution screens.js makes on .ccc-scr__hit, for the identical reason.
   2. THE RESTING FILL. §09's inset hairline ring and amber centre glint are
      drawn UNDER an opaque sheet, where the ring lands as a stray line along
      the paper's edge (and at a different angle, because the paper is tilted).
      Both come off.
   3. THE RETICLE MOVES OUTBOARD. The four brass corner brackets are the site's
      "this is clickable" language and they stay — but at inset 0 they print ON
      the page, which is the one thing this sheet must never look like. At -7px
      they frame it instead, which is also what a bracket is for.            */

   written once, from rooms.js, and never again.

   container-type is HERE and the sizes are all on descendants, which is not a
   style choice — an element cannot query itself, so a cqw written on .ccc-wp

/* ── THE CONTACT SHADOW, AND THE EXPOSURE ──────────────────────────────────
   Two shadows, because one is a blob and two is a contact: a tight, dark, almost
   un-offset one that pins the paper's edge to the wall, and a wide soft one
   thrown DOWN AND LEFT — away from the pendant at plate-x ~50%, which is the
   only real light above this wall. Both are in cqw of the sheet, so the same
   shadow renders at 1024 and at 2560 instead of a 4px shadow that is a third of
   a millimetre on one and a centimetre on the other.

   The grade is §4's. brightness carries the exposure; saturate keeps the paper
   from holding its warmth in a room that has not been lit, because an unlit
   surface loses chroma before it loses luminance. The filter is on THIS
   element and the clip is on .ccc-wp__paper below it — that order matters:
   clip-path is applied after filters, so a clip on the same element would cut
   the shadow off at the very corner the curl exists to soften. */

  position: absolute;

    brightness(var(--wp-exp))
    saturate(calc(0.68 + 0.32 * var(--wp-lit)));
}

/* ── THE PAPER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE CURL. The bottom-left corner has lifted off the wall, so the sheet's
   SILHOUETTE is cut there — from 90.5% down the left edge to 19% along the
   bottom. Because the clip is on the paper and the shadow is on its parent, the
   shadow follows that cut: it pools under the diagonal instead of squaring the
   corner off, which is the whole reason the object stops reading as a
   rectangle. ::after then lays a soft dark wedge along the inside of the cut —
   paper bending away from the light loses it.

     Toner spreads. A 0.18px stroke in the glyph's own colour is that, and it is
     the last term in §1's contrast argument rather than a decoration: at 8.4px
     a 700-weight stem covers about four fifths of the pixels it crosses, and
     four fifths of the way to the ink is not the ink. The stroke pushes the
     centre of each stem to full coverage without changing the letterform's
     colour, its width or its weight — the same thing a laser printer does to a
     6pt rule, and the reason a printed page reads darker than its PDF.

     MEASURED, the floor of three lit frames at 2560x1440, 1920x1080 and
     1366x768, every class on the sheet:
         no stroke ....... 6.43 : 1        0.10px ...... 6.43 : 1
         0.18px .......... 7.30 : 1        0.22px ...... 7.89 : 1
     0.22 and not 0.40, because past about a third of a pixel the counters in
     "8", "e" and "$" start to close at 6px and the page goes muddy — which is
     the same failure -webkit-font-smoothing caused from the other direction,
     and is why that one is still not here.

     ⚠ -webkit-text-stroke-COLOR is left alone deliberately: it defaults to
     currentColor, so the green payout column strokes green and the secondary
     ink strokes secondary. Setting it would flatten all four inks to one.

     ⚠ AND IT IS SCOPED TO THE LANDSCAPE SHEET, below, not declared here. The
     walk-in's note is a different stock at a different size with its own
     measured ink (§1b), it already clears the floor, and it is not this

   THE SECOND SURFACE  ·  .ccc-wp--cold  ·  THE NOTE IN THE WALK-IN
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Everything above this line is the Back Office sheet and is unchanged by it.
   The two surfaces share the plane, the shadow host, the paper host, the head
   and the footer; they share NOTHING below that, because they are not the same
   object. One is a landscape rate card someone ran off the office printer onto
   warm stock and taped to navy paint. This is a portrait note on cool stock,
   held to specular steel with a magnet, in a room that is 8x darker before the
   lights come up.

   THE TWO MODIFIERS. ".ccc-wp--card" and ".ccc-wp--cold" are on the PLANE, and
   every breakpoint block in this file now names one of them. That is not
   decoration either: the queries above were solved for a 1.262:1 sheet with two
   table columns in it, and an unscoped ".ccc-wp__paper { --wp-k: 1.42 }" would
   have re-set the type on a portrait document that has no columns to drop.

   ── WHY THE BOX IS PORTRAIT, AND WHY IT FILLS ──────────────────────────────
   Same argument as the landscape one, run the other way. .hotspots is the
   plate's COVER box (theme.css §06), so rooms.js's 11.2% x 26.0% is 268.8 x
   348.4 PLATE PIXELS — 0.7716:1. US Letter portrait is 8.5/11 = 0.7727:1. That
   is a 0.14% match. The sheet fills its box; there is no fit to solve.

   ── THE LIGHT, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The room's only practical is the ceiling fixture at plate-x ~60, plate-y
   5-15. The sheet's box runs 57.4 -> 68.6, so its centre is plate-x 63.0 and
   the fixture is 3 points to its LEFT and well above it. The contact shadow
   therefore falls DOWN and slightly RIGHT — the mirror of the office sheet,
   which is lit from a pendant at plate-x ~50 and throws down and LEFT.

   And it is TIGHTER AND HARDER than that one, for two reasons that are both in
   the photograph. The fixture is close (a shadow's penumbra grows with the
   angular size of the source over the distance to the receiver, and this source
   is one ceiling panel two metres up, not a room full of bounce), and the wall
   is polished stainless rather than matte paint — measured std dev over the
   note's box is 41/35/30 per channel against the office wall's 6.8/8.5/11.1,
   i.e. this surface has structure and specular roll-off and does not wash a
   shadow out. So the wide lobe comes in from 1.6cqw / 2.1cqw / 2.6cqw to
   0.5 / 1.25 / 0.95, and the tight one from 0.55cqw of blur to 0.26.

   ── THE EXPOSURE FLOOR, RE-DERIVED (§4's number is the office's) ───────────
   §4's --wp-exp is "0.30 + 0.70 x --wp-lit", and the 0.30 was solved from the
   BACK OFFICE's dark plate being 0.373x the luminance of its lit twin. This
   room is not that room. MEASURED over this sheet's own box, relative
   luminance of plates/freezer-dark.e3b8eb8f75.webp against plates/freezer.01697f04b3.webp: 0.0430 vs
   0.3455, i.e. 0.1245x — the walk-in goes far darker than the office does,
   which is the whole reason its reveal reads as a reveal.

   Keeping the paper's fall in step with the wall's means matching the office's
   own ratio between them: f^2.2 / r held constant, with f the brightness the
   paper takes at the dark end and r the wall's luminance ratio.

       office:   0.30^2.2 / 0.373  =  0.0703 / 0.373  =  0.1885
       walk-in:  f^2.2 = 0.1885 x 0.1245 = 0.02347   ->   f = 0.1816

   Rounded to 0.20, which is the same paper-to-wall relationship the Back Office
   sheet has and NOT a paler copy of its number. A sheet at 0.30 in here is a
   white rectangle glowing on a wall that has not been lit yet.

   (In practice the note is inserted the moment the door finishes opening, with
   the room already at --enter 1 / --bloom 1, so the floor is what you see when
   you scroll AWAY and back — which is exactly when it matters.)          */

/* ── THE PAPER, IN A WALK-IN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE COCKLE. Paper in a cold room with a compressor cycling on it does not
   stay flat — it takes up moisture along the free edges and waves. That is one
   clip-path and two very soft bands, and neither is allowed to read as a
   gradient: the bands are 3.5% and 2.5%, i.e. under the 6% ceiling the office
   sheen works to.

   THE SILHOUETTE. Held at the top by ONE magnet, so the sheet's free corner is
   the bottom RIGHT — the far side from the fixture, and the mirror of the
   office sheet's bottom-left curl. The bottom edge itself bows very slightly
   (the 98.8% mid-point), which is the cockle showing in the outline rather than
   only in the shading. The clip is on the paper and the shadow is on its
   parent, exactly as above, so the contact shadow follows the cut.

   THE SHEENS run the other way too: the broad one comes from the TOP LEFT
   (fixture at plate-x 60 against a sheet centred at 63) and the narrow cool one
   licks the RIGHT edge, which is the steel's own specular bounce.           */

/* ── THE MAGNET ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Tape does not stick to a cold, wet, stainless wall, and everybody who has
   ever worked a walk-in knows it. A magnet does. So the office sheet's two
   tabs become ONE disc at the top centre — which is also what makes the 1.1
   degrees rooms.js gives this sheet read as a note that has swung a little on
   its one fixing, instead of as a rectangle that was hung crooked.

   Same reasoning as the tape: it is a SIBLING of .ccc-wp__sheet, not a child,
   so it stays out of the sheet's contact shadow (which is the shadow of paper
   standing off a wall, and wrong for a 4mm disc lying on it) and carries its
   own tight one instead. It takes the same brightness(--wp-exp), so it comes up
   with the room. Graphite rather than brass: brass is this site's "you can
   click this" colour and theme.css §09's reticle is already using it 7px
   outboard — a second brass object on the same 40 pixels would read as UI. */

/* ── WHEN THIS PAPER GETS SMALL ────────────────────────────────────────────
   Read §5's note on the landscape sheet first — the mechanism, the reason the
   queries are anonymous, and the ⚠ about LAYOUT pixels versus the pixels you
   measure on screen all apply here unchanged. Only the numbers are this
   sheet's own, because this sheet is a different shape.

   MEASURED on the shipped build. The first pair is the bounding rect on screen
   across --p 0.10 to 0.55 (the plate is still dollying under the sheet, so it
   is a range and not a number); the last figure is what the container query
   actually sees, which is the plane's LAYOUT width — smaller, because .hotspots
   is scaled by --overscan-k and the plane is rotated on top of that:
       2560x1440             326-344 x 418-441   -> 289px   --wp-k 1
       1920x1080             244-258 x 313-331   -> 217px   --wp-k 1.18
       1600x900 / 1440x900   204-214 x 261-275   -> 181px   --wp-k 1.44
       1366x768 / 1024x768   174-183 x 223-235   -> 154px   --wp-k 1.72

   A portrait sheet answers "the paper got small" differently from a landscape
   one: the card had a second COLUMN to drop, and this has none. What it has is
   a stack, so it sheds from the BOTTOM — first the provenance block (which is
   where the numbers came from, not what they pay), then the two rows §2b marks
   "opt", then the head's eyebrow, then the condition lines. The eight things
   the estimate is actually made of are the last to go, and they never do.

   MEASURED at each step, page height used against page height available, with
   a 33-character heading standing in for the runtime one (long enough to set on
   one line down to 181px of container and on two below that): 274/274 at 289,
   210/210 at 217, 160/160 at 181, 170/176 at 154 — no overflow at any of them,
   and the footer clear of the curl at all four.

   ⚠ The heading is NOT in this file and cannot be — it is the decrypted tool's
   own label, arriving at render time (§7). So every figure above has to hold
   for a heading this module has never seen: the title wraps rather than
   truncates, and .ccc-wp__doc's overflow:hidden is what guarantees that a
   longer one can only ever cost a row off the foot of the page. */

     the six conditions cost 50.6px of a 176px column at this step's type size,
     and the column has 31px spare once they are off. There is no arrangement in

     conditions, which is under everything else on this page and under what the
     Back Office sheet was allowed to set. So they go — and the 31px that frees
     is more than the 26.4px the two "opt" rows cost (6px still spare after), so it
     closes back up to all eight. What was dropped at 195 was dropped to buy room
     for the conditions; with the conditions gone it fits again.

     Which leaves the smallest sheet as the complete list of what the estimate
     is made of, set larger, with nothing explained — and the medium one as a
     shorter list that explains itself. Both are things a printer does; a page
     of 5.8px grey is not. */

/* ── WHEN THE PAPER GETS SMALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   The sheet is a fixed fraction of the plate's COVER box, and that box is
   max(100cqw, 100svh x 1.791) x --overscan-k — so how many CSS pixels of paper
   there are is decided by the viewport's HEIGHT at least as often as by its
   width. It is also 41% less paper than it was: rooms.js moved this sheet off
   the wall corner (11.5 → 27.0 became 9.0 → 21.0, see §0) and 15.5% x 22.0% of
   the plate became 12.0% x 17.0%, i.e. 372 x 294.8 plate pixels became
   288 x 227.8. EVERY NUMBER BELOW WAS RE-SOLVED FOR THAT SHEET; none of them
   survived the move unchanged.

   Which is exactly why these queries are NOT on the stage. A stage-width query
   put 1366x768 and 1024x768 — the same paper — two steps apart and overflowed
   the smaller one by 49px. The queries below are anonymous, so they resolve
   against the nearest container, which is .ccc-wp: the sheet asks how many
   pixels of ITSELF there are and answers in its own terms.

   ⚠ THE THRESHOLDS ARE LAYOUT PIXELS, NOT THE PIXELS YOU MEASURE ON SCREEN.
   .hotspots is scaled by --overscan-k (1.10 by default, 1.06 at one breakpoint,
   1 under reduced motion) AND by --plate-scale, which runs 1.02 to 1.10 across
   a room's own runway. A container query resolves against the element's LAYOUT
   size, before any ancestor transform, so it does NOT move while the plate
   dollies — which is the one mercy in this: the step a viewport lands on is a
   constant, and only the pixels it renders at grow. MEASURED, layout container
   against bounding rect at --p 0.30 and at --p 1:

       2560x1440    309px container      347 → 376 on screen
       1920x1080    232px                260 → 282
       1600x900 / 1440x900   193px       217 → 235
       1366x768 / 1024x768   165px       185 → 201

   So a 165px container sets 8px type that renders at 9.1-9.7px. Do not
   "correct" the thresholds to the on-screen figures.

   ── THE LADDER, AND WHY IT TRADES THIS WAY ─────────────────────────────────
   A document that fits at 413 is grey mush at 165, and the answer a printer
   would give is not "set it smaller" — it is "print less of it". Every step
   below sheds from the BOTTOM of the tables and spends every pixel it frees on
   --wp-k, so the BODY SIZE STAYS FLAT while the CONTENT thins out:

     container   what is printed                          --wp-k   body px
     > 340       4 tables x 5 rows   (unchanged)           1.00     8.5+
     ≤ 340       4 tables x 4 rows                         1.08     8.36 @309
     ≤ 288       2 tables x 5 rows                         1.46     8.47 @232
     ≤ 216       2 tables x 4 rows, no GP column           1.78     8.61 @193
     ≤ 180       2 tables x 2 rows, no GP column           2.10     8.66 @165

   Before this pass the same four containers set 7.74 / 8.24 / 6.87 / 5.86px,
   i.e. the sheet got 41% smaller and the type came with it. Now it does not:
   the body holds 8.36-8.66px of LAYOUT type — 9.4 to 10.5 as rendered — at
   every desktop shape, and it is FLAT across all four of them. What moves
   instead is how many rows are on the page: sixteen, ten, eight, four.

   ── WHERE THE CEILINGS COME FROM, MEASURED ─────────────────────────────────
   Two of them, and they bind in different places.

   1. HEIGHT. The page is 79.29cqw tall (a 1.264:1 box) and everything on it is
      set in cqw, so WHETHER IT FITS DEPENDS ON --wp-k AND THE ROW COUNT ALONE
      and not on the container width at all. MEASURED, the --wp-k at which the
      content exactly fills the page:
          4 tables x 5 rows   1.01        2 tables x 5 rows   1.58
          4 tables x 4 rows   1.10        2 tables x 4 rows   1.84
                                          2 tables x 2 rows   2.40
      Every k above is set under its ceiling, and the slack that leaves is a
      few px of white above the footer rule — which is what the bottom of a
      printed excerpt looks like.

   2. THE WIDEST PRODUCT NAME, and this is the one that actually decides the
      ladder. "Sports & News" is 6.985em of the row's own font, and a column is
      a fixed fraction of the paper, so THAT ceiling is also width-independent:
      with both money columns on the row it caps --wp-k at about 1.50 no matter
      how much paper there is. That is why the last two steps drop the GP
      COLUMN rather than a row — dropping GP is worth 2.34em of measure and
      takes the ceiling to 1.93 — and why the last step then drops the row that
      holds the LONGEST NAME rather than the last row of the table: with
      "Sports & News" off the page "TV Premium" is the longest and the ceiling
      goes to 2.24. The commission is the number the sheet exists to print
      ("green = yours"); the store's gross profit is context, and the footer
      that explains it goes at the same step.

   ── WHAT IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   The title, the stamp, the footer's right half and the top three rows of both
   surviving tables. The footer is what says the page is an excerpt, and the
   whole object is a button that opens the full sheet.

   theme.css §17 removes the object hotspots entirely below 900px and on any
   viewport narrower than 8:7, and this sheet is a ".hotspots > .hotspot", so it
   goes with them — the same handoff to the rail's full-width tap list that the
   printer, the two clipboards and the recipe cards already make. That is the
   right answer and not a limitation: at 390px the whole plate is 24% of its
   width and this sheet would be 53 pixels of paper. */

   was setting 7.7px body. 340 is the container at which the full page still

   At the step above --wp-k is capped at 1.93 by "Sports & News" — 6.985em of a
   measure that holds 8.83em once the payout box and its gap are out of it —
   and 1.93 at 165px of container is 7.96px of body type, which floors at

   stay level; "TV Premium" becomes the longest name, the ceiling goes to 2.24

   on the smallest sheet. Four payouts set legibly beats six set grey, and the
   footer has said the page is an excerpt the whole way down.

   The eyebrow goes here too, and for the older reason: the head is two nowrap

/* ── THE ROOM'S OWN CROP, AND THE THREE DESKTOP SHAPES WHERE IT REACHES US ─
   This is a MEDIA query and everything above it is a container query, and the
   difference is the point: what follows is not about how big the sheet is, it
   is about which part of the PHOTOGRAPH is on screen.

   theme.css §06 sizes .hotspots to the plate's cover box and §06d gives the
   Back Office --art-x .5, so at aspects below the plate's own 1.791 the frame
   throws away (1 - aspect / (1.791 x --overscan-k x --plate-scale)) of the
   plate's width, half off each side — and --plate-scale runs 1.02 to 1.10
   across the room's runway, so the crop TIGHTENS as you scroll. That algebra
   predicts the threshold and not the amount (there is a --plate-x parallax
   translate in the transform as well), so what follows is measured.

   ── WHY THIS BLOCK HAD TO BE RE-SOLVED ─────────────────────────────────────
   The sheet's left edge used to be at plate-x 11.5 and is now at 9.0. Every
   one of those 2.5 points is 2.5% of the plate's width closer to the frame
   edge, so the shapes that crop it changed and the amount they crop changed
   with them. MEASURED, worst clip of the sheet's own box while the Back Office
   still owns the screen (i.e. up to the last frame elementFromPoint puts this
   hotspot on top), across the whole runway:

       aspect 1.90 / 1.80          0%            1706x900, 1620x900
       aspect 1.778 / 1.779        0%            2560x1440, 1920x1080,
                                                 1600x900, 1366x768
       aspect 1.70                 7.5%          1530x900
       aspect 1.60                 4 - 30%       1440x900, 1680x1050
       aspect 1.50                16 - 48%       1350x900
       aspect 1.40                37 - 67%       1260x900
       aspect 1.333               52 - 80%       1024x768
       aspect 1.25                69 - 96%       1280x1024

   The old block covered aspect < 38/25 (1.52) and would have left 16:10 —
   1440x900, 1680x1050, 1920x1200, one of the commonest desktop shapes there
   is — with its product names sheared off at the frame edge. The band now runs
   to 5/3 (1.667), which is where the measurement says the sheet stops being
   whole, and it is cut in two because 16:10 and 4:3 need very different
   answers.

   THIS IS THE ROOM'S COMPOSITION, NOT THIS MODULE'S, and rooms.js's geometry is
   measured and not ours to move. The same crop treats the room's other four
   objects far worse: 'fall-off' sits at plate-x 91.5-97.5, and by the same
   algebra its right edge is outside the frame at every aspect below 1.872 —
   which includes 1920x1080. The site has always shipped that.

   ⚠ WHAT THIS BLOCK CANNOT DO. Below about 4:3 the crop takes more than half
   the sheet before the room has finished arriving, and no amount of moving the
   printing about on the paper puts a two-figure table into what is left: at
   1280x1024 the sheet is 69% out of frame at arrival and 96% out of it by the
   time the room hands over. The fix for that is not in this file — it is an
   --art-x for the Back Office at those aspects in theme.css §17, or a plate-x
   for this hotspot in rooms.js. Both are the room's business. What is below
   holds to 4:3 and degrades honestly under it.

   What this module CAN do is decide which part of its own paper the printing
   lands on. Inside the band it sets the page to ONE column, indented past the
   part of the paper the frame is eating, so the surviving frame carries a
   complete, aligned, readable table with its title over it instead of two
   tables sheared off at the frame edge. A printer setting a page for a narrow
   window does exactly this. What survives is the Internet table, which is the
   one a rep quotes first, and the footer still says the sheet is an excerpt
   and the button still opens the whole tool.                                */

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 7 · buildWallPrint  ·  THE SEAM
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * app.js's buildHotspot() dispatches here on `kind:'print'` and nowhere else.
 * What comes back is a real <button data-tool> — the same element every other
 * object hotspot in the building is, so overlay.js's delegated click handler,
 * its `#/tool/<slug>` deep link, its gate and its focus restore all apply with
 * nothing added; the sheet is a decoration inside it. Keeping the drawing INSIDE
 * the button rather than beside it is what guarantees the client's "clickable
 * the whole time the room is on screen": there is exactly one hit target, it is
 * the paper, and it opens the moment theme.css §05's --cut leaves zero — which
 * is roughly 740px of scroll BEFORE the room reaches its arrival position, and
 * it stays open for the whole of the room's runway.
 *
 * ── HOW A SHEET FINDS ITS TOOL, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO WAYS ─────────────────
 * The Back Office sheet names its tool with a SLUG, because that tool ships in
 * data/tools.ac8a24642f.json in plaintext and always has. Resolution for it is a Map read
 * and it is unchanged, down to the label fallback order.
 *
 * The walk-in's note cannot do that. Its tool is one of the fourteen behind the
 * freezer's lock, and the whole point of that lock (app.js §2,
 * build/seal-freezer.mjs) is that the slug, the name and the URL ARE NOT IN THE
 * DEPLOYED TREE — they are AES-256-GCM ciphertext, and the sealing script fails
 * the build if any of the three survives into index.html or the envelope. A
 * `slug:'…'` in rooms.js would put all the effort back on the floor.
 *
 * So that hotspot names an OBJECT instead — the same `object` field every tool
 * in the index already carries ("clipboard-1", "recipe-card-2", "wall-print"),
 * which is a description of a thing in a photograph and not a key to anything.
 * The sheet then resolves LATE, against whatever tools exist by the time it is
 * asked:
 *
 *     spot.slug    -> data.bySlug.get(slug)                  the office sheet
 *     spot.object  -> data.tools.find(t => t.object === …)   the walk-in note
 *
 * ── AND THAT IS ALSO THE LOCK ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * While the walk-in is shut there is no such tool. app.js's index literally
 * does not contain it — `data.tools` holds the 23 plaintext tools and nothing
 * else until ADOPT_COLD() folds in a decrypted payload. So the find() returns
 * nothing, and THIS FUNCTION BUILDS NOTHING: no button, no data-tool, no
 * accessible name, no paper, no reticle. What goes into the hotspot layer is an
 * empty `hidden` span, which is neither painted, hit-tested, announced, nor
 * focusable.
 *
 * That is deliberately the SAME predicate the rest of the room gates on, not a
 * second one that could drift out of step with it. app.js's rail chips ask
 * `isFreezerUnlocked()`, which is `COLD !== null` — and ADOPT_COLD(), the only
 * thing that can put a tool into `data.tools`, is called from exactly one place:
 * markFreezerUnlocked(), the function that sets COLD. One state, two readings of
 * it. There is no arrangement of this page in which the note is drawn and
 * isFreezerUnlocked() is false.
 *
 * It also means the note cannot be summoned by a URL. A `#/tool/<slug>` deep
 * link is answered by overlay.js's openTool() and app.js's watchSealedDeepLink()
 * — neither of which can reach this module — and the only thing that could make
 * this sheet appear is a decrypted payload, which needs the code.
 *
 * ── THE REVEAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * revealWallPrints() re-resolves every deferred sheet and swaps it in place.
 * app.js calls it from playUnlockBeat(), beside revealFreezerInterior() — i.e.
 * as the door finishes opening and the room is handed over, the same beat the
 * fourteen rail chips ripple in on. Not at markFreezerUnlocked(): the code is
 * accepted about two seconds before the doorway clears, and a note that pops
 * into existence behind a door that is still swinging is a note you watched
 * appear.
 *
 * A session that was ALREADY unlocked never gets here at all — app.js restores
 * the payload before buildKitchen() runs, so the find() succeeds first time and
 * the note is simply part of the room, which is also how freezer.js treats the
 * door in that case.
 *
 * @param {object} spot  the rooms.js hotspot: x/y/w/h in plate %, rotate, and
 *                       either `slug` + `label` or `object`
 * @param {object} data  app.js's tool index — { tools, bySlug, … }. Live: it is
 *                       the same object ADOPT_COLD() mutates on unlock.
 * @param {Document} doc
 * @returns {HTMLElement}  a <button data-tool>, or an empty hidden <span>
