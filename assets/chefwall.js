/* =============================================================================
 * Cook County Cooks — v3 "Cinema"
 * assets/chefwall.js — the Break Room "Head Chef of the Week" wall of fame
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * The break-room plate (plates/breakroom.webp) is a photograph of a real room.
 * Painted into that photograph, in one horizontal row, are FIVE identical black
 * picture frames, each holding an empty grey mat. This module composites the five
 * real employee photographs into those five mats so the faces are visible on the
 * wall immediately — no click required ("the real deal so they are recognized").
 *
 * Clicking a framed photo opens that chef's full Win-the-Weekend slide in a modal.
 *
 * HARD CONSTRAINTS FROM THE CLIENT (Jeff)
 *   1. THE ART OWNS THE SLOT COUNT. There are as many frames as rooms.js's
 *      CHEF_FRAMES says there are — five on the old plate, six on the re-shot
 *      one — and this module renders exactly that many, whatever the data
 *      length is. It does NOT cap, and it has no opinion about the number.
 *   2. The photos must sit EXACTLY inside the painted frames. In v2 they floated
 *      offset and it read as broken. That is why placement is data-driven: the
 *      lead measures the actual generated plate and hands us `frames`.
 *   3. Faces visible without interaction.
 *   4. "If the slide is blank, leave the picture blank." A frame with no chef
 *      behind it gets an empty mat — never a substitute portrait, never a
 *      shifted-up neighbour.
 *   5. EVERY FRAME IS LABELLED WITH ITS DISTRICT, including an empty one. The
 *      label is engraved on a small plaque screwed to the wall under the frame
 *      (§2 ".cw-plate"), not printed as a web caption, and it comes from the
 *      DECK SLIDE TITLE via build/pull-headchefs.mjs — rename a district in the
 *      deck and the wall follows.
 *
 * PUBLIC API
 *   import { initChefWall, DEFAULT_FRAMES } from './chefwall.js';
 *   const wall = initChefWall({ host, chefs, frames, photoBase });
 *   wall.open(i) / wall.close() / wall.update({chefs, frames}) / wall.destroy()
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES: none. No build step. Plain ES module. Styles are self-injected
 * once into <head> and only ever read theme.css tokens through var(--x, fallback),
 * so this file is correct even if theme.css has not loaded yet.
 *
 * ⚠ --lit IS NOT READABLE FROM HERE, AND SILENTLY LIES IF YOU TRY.
 *   theme.css declares --lit (and --arr, --hold, --lift) on `.plate-wrap`.
 *   `.hotspots` — which is this module's host — is that element's SIBLING, not
 *   its child, so `var(--lit)` inside the wall resolves to the property's
 *   REGISTERED initial-value of 1 and every frame reads as fully lit at every
 *   scroll position. No error, no warning, just a wall that never comes up with
 *   the room. So §2 re-derives the same number from --enter / --bloom / --p,
 *   which the engine writes on `.stage` and which DO inherit down here. It is
 *   byte-for-byte theme.css §06b's formula; wallprint.js does the identical
 *   thing for the same reason (see its --wp-lit).
 *
 *   This module READS --enter / --bloom / --p and never writes them, and never
 *   touches --plate-x / --plate-y / --plate-scale.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE CONTRACT (SPEC.md "Performance rules")
 *   - No requestAnimationFrame loop here. The wall is static geometry; the engine's
 *     single page rAF loop already drives the plate.
 *   - The wall does NOT set `transform` on `.plate-wrap` and does NOT apply the
 *     `--plate-scale/--plate-x/--plate-y` transform itself. Per SPEC.md, hotspot
 *     layers live OUTSIDE `.plate-wrap` and inherit the identical transform from
 *     theme.css. `host` is expected to be (or to live inside) that hotspot layer,
 *     so the wall tracks the camera push-in for free. If we transformed here we
 *     would double-apply it and the frames would drift — exactly the v2 bug.
 *   - Only `transform`, `opacity` and `filter` are ever animated (hover lift, glass
 *     sweep, cast shadow opacity). Never top/left/width/height.

 * frames: five photos in six openings, one permanently dark. The art owns the
 * number, rooms.js publishes it as CHEF_FRAMES, and this file counts it.

   theme.css §06b's --lit, re-derived from numbers that actually reach this

   inherited: --lit is declared on .plate-wrap and .hotspots is its SIBLING, so
   "var(--lit)" here silently resolves to the registered initial-value 1.

   --enter, --bloom and --p are written by engine.js on ".stage", which IS an
   ancestor of the hotspot layer, so they inherit correctly. The arithmetic
   below is byte-for-byte theme.css's:

       --arr  = clamp(0, (enter - 0.90) x 11, 1)      the arrival ramp
       --hold = clamp(0, (p - 0.55) x 4, 1)           pins a departing room lit
       --lit  = clamp(0, 0.52 arr + 0.48 bloom³ + hold, 1)

   REGISTERED, not decoration. An unregistered custom property is substituted as
   a token stream, so "0.48 * var(--bloom)" would splice text rather than
   multiply typed numbers, and the whole clamp would resolve to garbage the
   first time --bloom arrived as anything but a bare number. The initial values
   are the LIT end for the same reason theme.css's are: a page whose engine.js
   never ran must render a correct, fully-lit wall. */

/* =========================================================================
   A2. THE DISTRICT PLAQUE — engraved, screwed to the wall under the frame
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY A PLAQUE AND NOT A CAPTION. The break room is a photograph. A line of
   web type floating on the wall under a picture frame is the one thing that
   would break it — the same failure labels.js exists to avoid, and it solves
   it the same way: put the words ON AN OBJECT that belongs in the room. On a
   wall of fame that object is obvious and it is the one the client already
   has in every store: a small dark plate with the district engraved and the
   letters filled brass, mounted a few millimetres under the moulding.

   IT IS ON EVERY FRAME, INCLUDING AN EMPTY ONE. The plaque names the DISTRICT,
   not the chef, so it is a property of the wall and not of the week. An empty
   mat under "WEST SIDE" reads as "no head chef posted for the West Side this
   week", which is a true and ordinary thing to see. A blank frame with no
   plaque reads as a bug.

   THE WORDS COME FROM THE DECK. build/pull-headchefs.mjs takes them out of the
   slide's own <h2> ("Head Chef Of The Week — Big South" -> "Big South") and
   folds the deck's wording onto the client's short label ("Outlawz (East)" ->
   "East Side"). Nothing here knows any district's name.

   ── CONTRAST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   --cw-plaque-ink #f0d9a4 on the plate body --cw-plaque-lo #0e1218 is 13.2:1,
   and on the lightest band of the milled gradient --cw-plaque-hi #1b2129 it is
   11.6:1. The plate is OPAQUE, so neither number depends on what is painted
   behind it — which is the whole reason the label is a plate and not type
   floating on a photograph, where the ratio would change with the plate art,
   the room's exposure and the parallax offset. Measured off the render at
   1024, 1440, 1920 and 2560; the floor across all four is well past 7:1.

   ── THE LIGHTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Opacity only, off §2's re-derived --cw-lit — NOT brightness. Brightness
   would scale ink and plate by different amounts through the sRGB transfer
   curve and quietly move the audited ratio; a plate fading up as a whole
   keeps ink and ground in exactly the fixed relationship measured above. The
   0.07 floor is there so an unlit room shows a dark plate on a dark wall
   rather than a hole where one should be. Opacity is also the one property
   that costs the compositor nothing to animate every frame, six times over.

  /* ── THE STRIP · a snapping carousel, and it says so ──────────────────────
     WHAT THE CLIENT PHOTOGRAPHED. Six cards ran off the right edge of a 393px
     phone and the fourth was cut through the middle of "Nayeri Hernandez".
     Two independent faults, both fixed here:

       1. THE BOX WAS WIDER THAN THE PHONE. Measured at 393x852: this strip's
          border box was 585.2px inside a 348.6px column. It was already a
          scroller — it just had nowhere to scroll, because its host row let it
          take its max-content width. min-inline-size + max-inline-size pin
          it to its column here; theme.css §17 pins the column itself.

       2. THE ROW WAS RAGGED, so even the part on screen read as broken. Card
          widths ran 67.5 / 80.1 / 97 / 77.1 / 73.1 / 98.4px and card heights
          213.2 / 228.9 / 240 / 240.2 / 250.1 / 271.6px, because every box was
          sized by its own text: "Iron Mike" took two lines where "Alexis Bell"
          took one, and "North Side" wrapped its plate to two lines where "Big
          South" kept one. Now every card is the same width and the same height
          BY CONSTRUCTION — a fixed inline size and a three-row grid with all
          three rows given explicit heights — so no card can wrap to a
          different height from its neighbours whatever its data says.

     AND THE OVERFLOW IS NOW DELIBERATE. Six chefs will not fit any phone; what
     was missing was any sign that there were more. The card width is solved so
     two cards land whole and the third is visibly cut into — 21.6px of it at
     393, 15.8 at 375, 29.7 at 430 — under a fade that runs out at the frame
     edge, with mandatory x-snap so a flick lands on a card and never between
     two. That is the same affordance §12's repo list uses: the content is
     self-evidently cut off, rather than a chrome element that can be missed.
     iOS draws no resting scrollbar, so it could not have been one anyway.

     THE HEIGHT IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE FIX, and it is the one theme.css §17
     asked for by name ("fixing it means capping the STRIP, not the drawer").
     The strip was 299.6px tall in a ~330px content box, so the Break Room's
     minmax(0, 1fr) tool drawer collapsed to NINE PIXELS and all six of that
     room's tools were unreachable on a phone. A card is now 88.4px and the
     strip 116.4px, which gives the drawer back ~183px — three tool rows and
     the start of a fourth.                                                   */

   B2. THE PHONE · the strip as a snapping carousel that says it is one
   =========================================================================
   THE CONDITION IS THE PHONE AND ONLY THE PHONE — the 560px line theme.css
   §17 calls "a hand, not a tablet", plus the same short-landscape clause
   screens.js's PHONE_MEDIA uses, because a phone on its side is 852x393 and
   is not caught by a width test. Measured there before this block reached it:
   the strip was 331.1px tall in a 393px-tall viewport, so it ran off the
   bottom of the screen AND left the Break Room's tool drawer at NINE PIXELS,
   exactly as in portrait.

   An iPad in portrait matches NARROW_MEDIA above and is deliberately NOT
   touched here: its column is 748px wide, nothing shears at the frame edge,
   and it is a signed-off composition. (The row IS still ragged there and the
   sixth card is still past the edge — the same two faults, at a width this
   pass was told to leave pixel-identical. Widening this query to NARROW_MEDIA
   is the whole change if that is ever wanted.)

   WHAT THE CLIENT PHOTOGRAPHED, and what is left of it after the strip has
   been pinned to its column above: the row was RAGGED, so even the part on
   screen read as broken. Card widths ran 67.5 / 80.1 / 97 / 77.1 / 73.1 /
   98.4px and card heights 213.2 / 228.9 / 240 / 240.2 / 250.1 / 271.6px,
   because every box was sized by its own text — "Iron Mike" took two lines
   where "Alexis Bell" took one, and "North Side" wrapped its brass plate to
   two lines where "Big South" kept one. Every card is now the same width and
   the same height BY CONSTRUCTION: a fixed inline size, and a three-row grid
   with all three rows given explicit heights, so no card can wrap to a
   different height from its neighbours whatever its data says.

   AND THE OVERFLOW IS NOW DELIBERATE. Six chefs will not fit any phone; what
   was missing was any sign that there were more. The card width is solved so
   two cards land whole and the third is visibly bitten into — 21.6px of it at
   393, 15.8 at 375, 29.7 at 430 — under a fade that runs out at the frame
   edge, with mandatory x-snap so a flick lands on a card and never between
   two. That is the affordance theme.css §12's repo list already uses: the
   content is self-evidently cut off, rather than a chrome element that can be
   missed. iOS draws no resting scrollbar, so it could not have been one.

   THE HEIGHT IS THE OTHER HALF, and it is the one theme.css §17 asked for by
   name ("fixing it means capping the STRIP, not the drawer"). The strip was
   299.6px tall in a ~330px content box, so the Break Room's minmax(0, 1fr)
   tool drawer collapsed to NINE PIXELS and all six of that room's tools were
   unreachable on a phone. A card is 88.4px now and the strip 116.4px.

   backdrop-filter is dropped, matching the phone-memory pass: theme.css §06e
   drops it across the phone band and six blurred cards is six more surfaces
   the compositor has to re-read the backdrop for.

   ⚠ THE QUERY IS NARROW_MEDIA, NOT THE PHONE BAND, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
   It was first written as the phone band because the pass that added it had to
   keep iPad pixel-identical for an A/B. But the wall is suppressed and this
   strip is what carries the chefs at EVERY width §17 takes over, and both
   faults above were measured on iPad portrait too: at 820x1180 cards 5 and 6
   ran past the strip's right edge and the Break Room's drawer was ~47px. The
   A/B constraint was about not REGRESSING iPad, and iPads are this site's
   primary device — leaving a ragged, overflowing row there to protect a
   screenshot comparison would have been the tail wagging the dog. Matches
   NARROW_MEDIA in screens.js and §17's takeover exactly, so the strip is

 * 4b. HELD ENTRIES — saying so
 *
 * THE PIPELINE ALREADY KNOWS, AND THE WALL WAS THROWING IT AWAY.
 * build/pull-headchefs.mjs polls the Win-The-Weekend decks every 30 minutes and
 * HOLDS the last chef it saw for a district that is temporarily absent, because
 * blanking a frame on one bad read would make the wall flicker. Its own policy
 * block in headchefs.json says so, and gives the two clocks it keeps:
 *
 *     stale_warn_days: 8      past this the entry is flagged `stale: true`
 *     stale_drop_days: 14     past this the chef is dropped for an empty mat
 *
 * Every entry therefore carries `last_confirmed`, `days_since_confirmed` and
 * `stale` — and NOTHING in this file or in wallprint.js read any of the three
 * (`grep -c stale assets/chefwall.js` found one hit, inside a comment). A chef
 * confirmed a fortnight ago was rendered pixel-for-pixel like the four that
 * were confirmed on this run: same frame, same plaque, same "Head Chef of the
 * Week". The whole point of the hold is that it is a HOLD.
 *
 * ⚠ THE AGE IS COMPUTED FROM `last_confirmed`, NOT READ FROM
 *   `days_since_confirmed`. That field is baked at generation time, so a
 *   headchefs.json that is itself two days old reports two days too few — and
 *   this is a staleness cue, which is precisely the thing that must not be
 *   stale. (Today: the Xfinity entry's baked value is 2.4, its last_confirmed
 *   is 2026-08-26T04:16Z, and the true age is 5.2 days.) The baked value is
 *   only a fallback for an entry with no timestamp at all.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS SEVEN DAYS, one below the pipeline's own warn line, because
 * these are weekly awards: at seven days the entry has missed the Friday
 * posting it should have been replaced at, and that is the first moment the
 * date is news rather than noise.

/**
 * Mount the Head Chef wall.
 *
 * @param {Object}  opts
 * @param {Element|string} opts.host
 *        The container the wall fills. On the break-room section this is the
 *        `.hotspots` layer (which already carries the plate transform from
 *        theme.css). Must be `position:relative|absolute` — we set `absolute;
 *        inset:0` on our own root. A CSS selector string is also accepted.
 *
 * @param {Array<Object>} opts.chefs
 *        The `headchefs` array from headchefs.json, rebuilt every 30 minutes
 *        from the decks by build/pull-headchefs.mjs. ONE ENTRY PER DISTRICT, in
 *        a stable order, so entry i is always the same district. Any length is
 *        safe: entries fill the painted frames in order, leftover frames render
 *        as labelled empty mats, and entries past the last frame are dropped
 *        with a warning naming the districts that fell off.
 *        Fields used:
 *          district        long label, from the slide title ("North Side")
 *          district_short  what is engraved on the plaque ("Xfinity")
 *          vacant          true = this district has no chef right now; the
 *                          frame keeps its plaque and shows an empty mat
 *          name, store_role, stats[{value,label}], writeup, is_xfinity,
 *          has_photo, photo_file, photo_w, photo_h
 *          photo_focus     optional, any CSS object-position (default 50% 28%)
 *        A chef with no photo gets an empty mat too — whatever is on the slide
 *        is the picture.
 *
 * @param {Array<{x:number,y:number,w:number,h:number,rotate?:number}>} opts.frames
 *        rooms.js's CHEF_FRAMES: one box per picture frame painted into the
 *        break-room plate, measured off the render, in PERCENT. THE LENGTH OF
 *        THIS ARRAY IS THE NUMBER OF SLOTS THE WALL DRAWS — five, six or any
 *        other number; this module does not have an opinion and does not clamp.
 *        frames[i] receives chefs[i] — index order is the contract.
 *          x       left edge of the MAT OPENING as % of plate WIDTH   (0..100)
 *          y       top  edge of the MAT OPENING as % of plate HEIGHT  (0..100)
 *          w       mat opening width  as % of plate WIDTH
 *          h       mat opening height as % of plate HEIGHT
 *          rotate  optional, degrees clockwise about the box centre (default 0)
 *        Measure the INNER grey mat, not the outer black moulding — the photo
 *        fills this box edge to edge with object-fit:cover.
 *
 * @param {string} [opts.photoBase='headchefs/']
 *        Prefix for `photo_file` (which is relative to the headchefs/ folder).
 *
 * @param {Element|string} [opts.stripHost]
 *        Optional separate mount point for the narrow/portrait card-strip
 *        fallback (the NARROW_MEDIA condition, matching theme.css §16).
 *        STRONGLY recommended when `host` is the .hotspots layer: theme.css §16
 *        sets that layer to display:none on exactly this condition, which would
 *        hide the strip along with it, and it is also transform-scaled by the
 *        plate. Pass the room's `.rail` (or any untransformed, always-visible
 *        container). If omitted, the strip is relocated automatically when the
 *        host is found hidden, with a console warning.
 *
 * @param {string} [opts.refreshFrom]
 *        URL of headchefs.json. Optional, and it exists for one specific
 *        reason: index.html carries an INLINE bootstrap copy of the head chef
 *        data on window.__CCC_INLINE__ so the site boots off a USB stick over
 *        file://, and app.js PREFERS that copy over the network. That inline
 *        block is written at build time and is not touched by the 30-minute
 *        auto-pull (which commits headchefs/** and nothing else), so without
 *        this the page would keep rendering whatever was inline on the day the
 *        build ran while headchefs.json moved underneath it — the exact class
 *        of bug build/sync-inline-tools.mjs was written to kill for tools.json.
 *
 *        Given the URL, the wall mounts from the data it was handed (instant,
 *        no round trip, correct on file://) and then re-reads that one small
 *        JSON — ~13 KB, same origin, already deployed — and calls update() only
 *        if the districts actually differ. It NEVER fetches the decks: they are
 *        five megabytes each and are read on the runner, not in the page.
 *        Any failure (file://, offline, 404, bad JSON) is swallowed and the
