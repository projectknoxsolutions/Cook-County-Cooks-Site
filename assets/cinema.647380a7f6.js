 * Cook County Cooks — v3 "Cinema"
 * assets/cinema.js  ·  THE INTEGRATOR
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS FILE USED TO BE app.js AND IS OTHERWISE UNCHANGED. app.js is now a ~2 KB
 * router that decides, before first paint, whether this device gets the
 * restaurant or the pocket list, and dynamic-imports one of the two. Everything
 * below is the restaurant. A phone never reaches this file — and that is the
 * point: engine, overlay, screens, chefwall, labels, wallprint and freezer are
 * ~700 KB of modules and eight full-bleed plates, on a device whose whole web
 * content budget is around 200 MB and which was crashing under it.
 *
 * The one export is boot(); the router calls it. Nothing else changed.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The four feature modules (engine, overlay, chefwall, theme) know nothing about
 * each other. This file is the only place that does. Its whole job is:
 *
 *   1. turn rooms.js geometry + tools.json data into the DOM contract in SPEC.md
 *   2. hand each module the exact hooks its own doc comment asks for
 *   3. boot them in the one order that works
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO — read this before editing:
 *   · It must never write --p, --plate-scale, --plate-x, --plate-y, --enter or
 *     --bloom. Those six numbers belong to engine.js alone (SPEC.md §"CSS custom
 *     properties"). Everything cinematic is composed in theme.css from them.
 *   · It must never set transform on .plate-wrap.
 *   · It must never introduce a CSS class theme.css does not already style, and
 *     it must never turn on `scroll-behavior: smooth` (see NOTE 1 below).
 *
 * NOTE 1 — the scroll-behavior land mine.
 *   theme.css §03 sets `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }`. engine.js implements
 *   scrollToRoom() as a per-frame `window.scrollTo(0, y)` tween inside its own
 *   rAF loop. With CSS smooth scrolling on, EVERY one of those ~60 writes starts
 *   its own native smooth animation, the two fight, and the top menu ends up
 *   crawling to the wrong place — the exact bug that broke v2's menu. We turn it
 *   off from here, on the element, at boot. This is the countermeasure, not a
 *   violation of the "never smooth" rule.
 *
 * NOTE 2 — why some hosts are full-bleed.
 *   theme.css §09 sizes every direct child of .hotspots from --x/--y/--w/--h
 *   (defaulting to 10% x 10%). chefwall.js and a perspective screen both want a
 *   host that is the WHOLE plate box, because their own percentages are measured
 *   in plate space. So those hosts are given --w:100%/--h:100% explicitly rather
 *   than being allowed to fall through to the 10% default.
 *
 * Plain ES module. No build step, no npm, no framework, no external JS.

/**
 * The cinematic plate.
 *
 * ── WHY `sizes` IS NOT `100vw`, AND WHY THAT IS THE HONEST VALUE ──────────
 * The old comment here claimed an iPad would take the 1400w cut. It never did.
 * Two things were wrong with the reasoning:
 *
 *   1. DPR. Every shipping iPad is DPR 2, so `sizes: 100vw` asks for 2 device
 *      pixels per CSS pixel — 2048px in portrait, 2732px in landscape — and the
 *      2400w plate won every single time. Measured `currentSrc` at DPR 2, not
 *      DPR 1, confirms it: 154KB per plate instead of 68KB, and ~2.2x the raster
 *      area and layer memory, feeding straight into compositor cost.
 *   2. The cover box. theme.css §06 sizes .plate-wrap to
 *      `max(100cqw, 100svh * 1.79)`, so in a PORTRAIT viewport the plate is far
 *      wider than the viewport — 2446 CSS px on a 1024x1366 iPad. `100vw` was
 *      never the real box in the first place; it was under-declared already and
 *      simply saturated at the largest candidate.
 *
 * The mathematically-correct value would ask for ~4900 device pixels on an iPad
 * and there is no such plate.
 *
 * ── CORRECTED 2026-08-26 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The old value here was `(max-width: 1400px) 65vw, 100vw`, a deliberate
 * under-declaration that traded resolution for raster area. That trade was
 * sound when theme.css sized .plate-wrap to `inset: -5%` — a 110vw box. It is
 * not sound now: §06 sizes the wrap to the plate's COVER box, which on a
 * portrait viewport is `100svh * 1.79104`, i.e. 258vw on an iPad in portrait.
 * Declaring 65vw against a 258vw box asked the browser for a quarter of the
 * pixels the layout actually uses, and it correctly obliged: the 1400w cut,
 * upscaled 3.7x, was being painted into a 5186-device-pixel box. Rendered and
 * compared side by side against the 2400w cut at true device resolution, the
 * difference is not subtle — mushy lamp rims, no brick texture, smeared
 * speculars on the steel. Exactly the kind of soft photograph this client
 * rejects builds over.
 *
 * So `sizes` now describes the real box. Two branches, no calc() or max(),
 * because both have to work inside <link imagesizes> too:
 *
 *   viewport wider than the plate  -> the cover box is 100vw  -> 110vw
 *   viewport taller than the plate -> the cover box is 179.1vh -> 197vh
 *
 * (110 and 197 fold in theme.css's --overscan-k of 1.10.) Where that lands:
 *
 *   820x1180  DPR2 (iPad portrait)  -> 4649px -> 2400w
 *   1180x820  DPR2 (iPad landscape) -> 3230px -> 2400w
 *   1366x1024 DPR2 (iPad Pro land.) -> 4034px -> 2400w
 *   1440x900  DPR1 (store desktop)  -> 1773px -> 1800w
 *   2560x1440 DPR1                  -> 2837px -> 2400w
 *
 * iPad now takes the 2400 cut on both orientations, which is the honest answer:
 * a 16:9 plate cover-cropped into a portrait viewport genuinely needs its full
 * width. Cost is ~180KB per plate over the 1400 cut, on lazy images, on store
 * wifi. Verify any change to this line with `currentSrc` at
 * `deviceScaleFactor: 2`, and keep index.html's imagesizes identical.
 *
 * ── LOADING, WITH THE REAL NUMBERS ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Only the hero is eager. `pass` used to be too, but Chrome's lazy threshold is
 * generous enough that it — and `host`, the THIRD plate — are fetched at first
 * paint anyway at every viewport, so marking them eager only took bandwidth off
 * the hero, which is the LCP element. `lazy` does not stop that fetch; the
 * `fetchpriority: low` below is what keeps it from racing the hero.
 *
 * Measured cold load, not guessed (an earlier version of this comment claimed
 * ~230KB and was wrong by more than 2x, which is how the DPR bug above survived
 * so long — so these are `content-length` sums off a real navigation):
 *
 *   iPad portrait  1024x1366 DPR2   4 plates   370KB   (was 536KB / 3 plates)
 *   iPad landscape 1366x1024 DPR2   4 plates   546KB   (was 536KB / 3 plates)
 *   phone           390x844  DPR2   5 plates   462KB
 *   store desktop  2560x1440 DPR1   3 plates   536KB   (unchanged, correctly)
 *
 * Per plate is the number that moved and the number that matters for the
 * compositor: 68-92KB instead of 154-180KB, and roughly 0.45x the raster area.
 * The count of plates Chrome decides to pull at first paint is a function of the
 * room runway (--room-run, theme.css §02), not of anything this file controls.

/**
 * ── THE PHONE BAND, AND WHY `sizes` HAS A BRANCH FOR IT ──────────────────
 * ADDED 2026-08-28, after a shipped-site crash: "the site keeps crashing on my
 * iPhone ... it works well on iPads and desktops ... when I scroll down the
 * site crashes and it turns into a blue screen". Blue ground with every layer
 * above it gone, then unresponsive, is WebKit killing the tab's web content
 * process under memory pressure. iPhones have a far smaller per-tab budget than
 * iPads, which is exactly why one reproduced it and the other did not.
 *
 * MEASURED, at 390x844 DPR 3 in a real device profile, reading `currentSrc` off
 * every plate and multiplying each RESOURCE's pixels by 4 bytes (a decoded
 * bitmap costs its pixel count regardless of how small the WebP is):
 *
 *   eight lit plates, all at the 2400 cut .......... 98.2 MB
 *   eight dark twins, at the 1800 cut (§06b's cap) .. 55.2 MB
 *   the chef wall's three photographs ............... 2.6 MB
 *                                                    -------
 *   resident at the bottom of the runway ........... 156 MB
 *
 * and it climbs MONOTONICALLY with scroll depth — 105 MB at the hero, 143 MB by
 * the Prep Station, 156 MB in the walk-in — which is precisely the shape of the
 * report. That is before the compositor's own backing stores and before the two
 * live iframes, on a device whose whole budget is around 200 MB.
 *
 * The branch below is why the phone was taking the 2400 cut in the first place,
 * and it was not a bug in `sizes` — it was `sizes` being HONEST. §06 sizes
 * .plate-wrap to the plate's cover box, which in a 390x844 portrait viewport is
 * `100svh * 1.79104` = 1512 CSS px, and §17's --overscan-k lifts it to 1602.
 * `197vh` resolves to 1663 CSS px, x DPR 3 = 4988 device px, and the 2400 cut
 * duly won. The declaration was right; what was wrong was spending the honest
 * answer on a device that cannot afford it — and only ~24% of that 1602px box
 * is ever on screen (390 / 1602), so three quarters of those 98 MB are decoded
 * for pixels the phone crops away.
 *
 * So the phone band under-declares, deliberately, and says so:
 *
 *   440px  x DPR 3 -> 1400 / 440 = 3.18 >= 3  -> the 1400 cut
 *          x DPR 2 -> 3.18 >= 2               -> the 1400 cut
 *          x DPR 1 -> 3.18 >= 1               -> the 1400 cut
 *
 * Every iPhone lands on 1400 in both orientations, at 4.4 MB a plate instead of
 * 12.3, and NOTHING ELSE MATCHES THE BRANCH. The two conditions are the phone
 * and only the phone:
 *
 *   (max-width: 500px)                       every iPhone in portrait (320-440)
 *   (max-width: 1000px) and (max-height: 500px)   every iPhone in landscape
 *                                            (568-956 wide, 320-440 tall)
 *
 * They are deliberately NOT §17's `(max-width: 900px), (max-aspect-ratio: 8/7)`
 * takeover, and not §06b's `(min-width: 901px)` dark-plate cap: both of those
 * catch an iPad — iPad Pro portrait by aspect, iPad mini portrait at 744px by
 * width — and the iPads work today. Nothing here may reach them. Verify any
 * change to this line by reading `currentSrc` at deviceScaleFactor 2 AND 3, on
 * both a 390x844 and an 820x1180 profile, and keep index.html's `imagesizes`
 * and freezer.js's buildDoorImg() identical to it.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, LOOKED AT RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The 1400 cut, the 1200 and the
 * 1000 were rendered side by side at this exact presentation geometry — same
 * 1602px box, same crop, DPR 3, ungraded and unveiled, which is far harsher
 * than the phone ever shows it. At 1200 the subway grout in the Prep Station
 * starts to smear and the ruled lines on the recipe cards go; at 1000 both are
 * gone and the scissor clips are blobs. At 1400 the grout, the card rules and
 * the clips all survive. 1400 is the floor, so 1400 is what the phone takes —
 * and it does not need to go lower: with §06b's dark twins off in the same band
 * this leaves 35 MB of plates where there were 153.

/**
 * The rail: kicker, title, rule, and a chip for EVERY tool in the room.
 *
 * ── NO ROOM DESCRIPTION, ANYWHERE ON THE ART (2026-08-28) ──────────────────
 * The client, on the whole site: "I love the Title of each page to be on the
 * screen … however, I don't like the descriptions on the page … for instance,
 * on the pass, I love the title and the clickable boxes with the links in them,
 * but I don't like the 'Quotes fired and plated — the tools you touch on every
 * sale'. I want those types of descriptions to be removed on every page." His
 * reason is compositional — "I think that would make the slides fit better" —
 * and it is a real one: the tagline was the only row in this stack whose height
 * came from the length of a sentence, and it pushed everything above it further
 * up the frame into whatever the photograph put there. The Break Room is the
 * proof (§08a): its title ran into the head chef frames.
 *
 * `meta.tagline` IS STILL IN THE DATA, deliberately not deleted:
 *   · `blurb` on each TOOL is a different string with a different job — the
 *     viewer prints it — and has to survive untouched. Hand-deleting one of
 *     the two description fields out of tools.json is how you lose the other,
 *     and tools.json is not one file: index.html inlines a copy that app.js
 *     PREFERS over the fetch (see build/sync-inline-tools.mjs), so a data
 *     deletion is a two-file edit plus a build step, for no visible gain;
 *   · nothing renders it any more, so keeping it costs exactly nothing on
 *     screen. THE ONLY OTHER READER IS buildFooter() IN §6, and that function
 *     is not called — the client had the footer recap removed earlier ("I want
 *     the freezer to be the last thing someone could see"). The C³ menu, which
 *     IS the tool index now, never carried a description and still does not;
 *   · if he asks for them back it is one line here.
 * So this builds FOUR children, not five, and theme.css §08 / §08a / §17 are
 * re-balanced around four rows.
 *
 * The chip list is the client's hard requirement ("links must be easy to find"):
 * a tool with no hotspot — every one of the freezer's manager tools, the head
 * chef wall — is still one tap away here, and below 900px theme.css turns this
 * same list into the full-width drawer because hotspots are suppressed there.
 *
 * ── THE ONE EXCEPTION: THE WALK-IN WHILE IT IS SHUT ────────────────────────
 * The freezer's brief is "I want to actually see a freezer door that is CLOSED …
 * when someone types in the password it will OPEN the freezer door to this
 * screen. I want to have all of the manager tools HERE ON THIS SCREEN." The
 * tools arrive AFTER the door. Fourteen padlocked chips rendered up front
 * stacked seven rows deep across the left half of the leaf — spoiling the
 * reveal and burying the most cinematic frame on the site under its own table
 * of contents.
 *
 * So while the gate is shut the rail carries ONE row, not fourteen: the same
 * locked affordance the C³ menu and the footer index have always shown. This is
 * not a new gating rule, it is the existing one applied consistently —
 * renderList() in §5 and renderGroups() in §6 both already collapse the freezer
 * to a single `[data-freezer-lock]` control off this same predicate and both
 * re-render the full list through onFreezerUnlock(). The rail is the third
 * surface and it now behaves like the other two; playUnlockBeat() is its
 * re-render, and it is also the reveal.
 *
 * NOTHING BECOMES UNREACHABLE BY DOING THIS, and that is load-bearing:
 *   · the door is not the only route in — this chip, the C³ menu's locked row
 *     and the footer's button all open the same keypad, from any scroll
 *     position, with the keyboard, and without ever seeing the door;
 *   · the gate itself is untouched. overlay.js still evaluates canOpen/onRefused
 *     inside openTool(), so a `#/tool/<slug>` deep link into a freezer tool on a
 *     cold load still refuses and still routes through the keypad;
 *   · the instant the predicate flips, all fourteen are listed here, in the C³
 *     menu and in the footer — and the footer's are plain `<a href>`s, which is
 *     the no-JS, no-cinema path.

/**
 * The reward beat when the door opens — the rail's half of the reveal.
 *
 * "When someone types in the password, it will open the freezer door TO THIS
 * SCREEN. I want to have all of the manager tools HERE ON THIS SCREEN." So this
 * is the moment the fourteen actually arrive: the locked row is swapped for the
 * real list, which is then brought up to full strength in a short left-to-right
 * ripple — the room visibly filling, using nothing but opacity.
 *
 * WHY THE INSERT AND THE RIPPLE ARE THE SAME FUNCTION. A re-render on its own
 * blinks: the elements are new, so there is nothing for a transition to run
 * from. The chips are therefore inserted already carrying `opacity: 0` and
 * their staggered `transition`, and raised on the next frame, which is the same
 * beat the previous version got by mutating chips that were already on screen.
 * There is exactly one of these; freezer.js takes it as `onRevealed` and fires
 * it at the end of the door animation (or immediately when there is no door),
 * and it is idempotent, so a second unlock event is a no-op.
 *
 * Under reduced motion the list is simply there — no fade, no stagger — which
 * matches the door, which under that query is simply open.
 *
 * The keypad hotspot goes at the same time. It was the freezer's only hotspot
 * and, once unlocked, `if (isFreezerUnlocked()) return;` left it a dead object
 * sitting in the photograph. There is no honest thing to repoint it at — the
 * other fourteen tools have no measured geometry in rooms.js, and inventing a
 * box would hang a label on the wrong object — so the room hands over to its
 * rail, which is how the freezer was specified in the first place.

 * Fixed by theme.css §11, so it is reachable at any scroll position and nobody
 * is ever forced to scroll through rooms to get somewhere. The tickets are real
 * anchors (#room-pass), so they work with JS disabled and can be opened in a new
 * tab; when JS is alive we preventDefault and hand the jump to the engine, whose
 * tween is the thing that keeps the cinema in sync with the scroll position.

/** Where the phone's two-row course menu breaks its lines.
 *
 *  ⚠ THIS IS A MARKUP CONSTANT WITH A LAYOUT CONTRACT. theme.css §17 turns the
 *  strip into two flex rows below 560px and reserves the C³ button's column on
 *  the FIRST row only, so the split has to be "the wide row first". Four /
 *  three is what the seven room names measure to: at 375px CSS — the narrowest
 *  phone this site is built for — the first row's four tickets need 237px of a
 *  275px allowance and the second row's three need 262px of 351px. Five in the
 *  first row overflows the C³ reserve at every phone width. If a room is ever
 *  added or a `short` label lengthened, re-measure before touching this.
 *
 *  Above 560px both rows are `display: contents` and this constant has no
 *  visible effect at all — the seven tickets sit in one flex strip exactly as
 *  they always have. */

       than removing one. Measured at 1180x820 — iPad landscape, coarse pointer,
       where the seven tickets are 771px of content in a 737px box — walking
       into the Walk-In scrolled the strip 34px so "07 FREEZER" came whole into
       view and "01 PASS" went 34px under the left mask instead. One cut item
       for another, plus a bar that moves under the reader while they are
       reading it, which is half of what the client photographed on his phone.

       On a phone this would be dead code anyway: theme.css §17 puts all seven
       tickets on two rows below 560px, so there is no overflow to scroll and
       the current room is visible because every room is. The 1180x820 shear
       was real and was left for a later pass because every candidate fix
       repainted a signed-off iPad layout; that constraint was lifted on
       2026-09-02 and it is FIXED IN theme.css ("THE COURSE MENU ON AN iPAD IN
       LANDSCAPE"): a C³ reserve sized to the button, --sp-3 tickets, and the
       wordmark off the bar below 1120px. Measured after: 700px of tickets in
       a 790px box at 1180x820, 694 in 855 at 1024x768 — nothing overflows on
       any iPad in landscape, so there is still nothing here to scroll. */

     THE PANEL IS A MODAL DIALOG, AND NOW BEHAVES LIKE ONE.

     THE DEFECT, MEASURED. It said `role="dialog"`, moved focus in, restored it
     on Escape — and then set no trap and left #kitchen live. Opening it and
     pressing Tab forty times, focus left the panel on 16 of the 40 presses and
     landed on the skip link, the brand, the seven ticket links and then straight
     into the rooms behind the glass. This list is the one flat, reliable index
     of all 37 tools — the fallback for exactly the visitor who cannot work the
     hotspots — so falling out of it is the worst place on the page to fall out
     of.

     WHICH OF THE TWO HONEST ANSWERS THIS IS. A dialog that is not modal has to
     drop role="dialog" and close on focus-out; a dialog that is modal has to
     trap and inert. Modal is the right one here: the panel is up to 78svh of
     backdrop-blurred glass, everything behind it is a duplicate of something
     inside it, and Escape-closes-and-restores was already the behaviour. So the
     ARIA now matches: aria-modal="true", the background inert, Tab cycling.
     chefwall.js's chef modal is the model — same FOCUSABLE list, same
     skip-already-inert bookkeeping, same restore. Measured after: 0 of 40.

     #c3-button IS DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT OF THE INERT SET. It is this dialog's
     only close affordance — there is no ✕ in the panel — and an inert button
     ignores pointer events, so inerting it would leave a touch user who cannot
     press Escape with nothing to tap but the background. It is outside the tab
     cycle and aria-modal already hides it from assistive tech; what it keeps is
     the tap that closes the thing. Click-away still works too: Chromium
     re-targets a click on inert content to the nearest non-inert ancestor, so
     the document listener below still sees it (verified — closing by clicking
     the plate behind the panel works with the background inert).             */

   * onRefused into the keypad. That refusal is not weakened — it still fires
   * for anything the registry knows about — but a sealed slug is not in the
   * registry, and overlay.js's own answer for an unknown slug is one
   * console.warn and nothing else.
   *
   * That is a STRONGER refusal (there is nothing to open, and the URL leaks
   * nothing back) but a worse manager: someone with a bookmark to a manager
   * tool would get a silent dead page. So we catch it here. The rule is
   * deliberately narrow — a hash that names a tool this build has never heard
   * of, while the walk-in is shut — and its only effect is to offer the
   * keypad. It never confirms whether the slug is one of the fourteen: a wrong
   * slug and a real one behave identically right up until the code decrypts.
