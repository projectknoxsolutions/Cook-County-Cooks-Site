 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL
 *
 *   Both the tool viewer (overlay.js) and the live boards on the Dining Room
 *   wall (screens.js) decided "did this load?" by putting the URL in an iframe,
 *   waiting for `load`, and then reading `frame.contentWindow.document`. That
 *   read throws a SecurityError for a real cross-origin document, so the throw
 *   was taken as the success signal and the catch returned "it loaded".
 *
 *   IT THROWS FOR EVERY FAILURE TOO. Measured in Chromium on 2026-08-31, each
 *   shape in its own iframe, all of them firing `load` in 8-23 ms:
 *
 *     shape                          load  contentWindow.document  verdict given
 *     ─────────────────────────────  ────  ──────────────────────  ────────────

 *
 *   Eleven of the twelve are indistinguishable from inside the page. There is
 *   nothing else to read: contentDocument is null for all of them, so is
 *   contentWindow.length, and `origin`, `location.href` and `document` all
 *   throw identically. A rep got a grey void, a fade-in, and role="status"
 *   announcing "<tool> loaded."
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT DOES DISCRIMINATE
 *
 *   fetch(). Every tool in data/tools.ac8a24642f.json is a GitHub Pages document, and
 *   GitHub Pages answers with `access-control-allow-origin: *`. Verified by
 *   curl against the real hosts on 2026-08-31:
 *
 *     GET/HEAD  …/Mobile-Quote-Sheet-6th-Gen/            200  ACAO: *
 *     GET/HEAD  …/Mobile-Quote-Sheet-6th-Gen/nope.html   404  ACAO: *
 *     GET/HEAD  …/definitely-not-a-real-repo/            404  no ACAO
 *     GET/HEAD  https://blufoxmobile.github.io/          404  no ACAO
 *
 *   So a cross-origin `fetch` reads a REAL STATUS CODE for a Pages site that
 *   exists, whatever that status is, and is refused only when there is no Pages
 *   site there at all. That last case is the "repo renamed / Pages turned off"
 *   failure, and it is the likeliest one of the lot — which is why the second,
 *   `no-cors` probe below exists: it separates "the origin answered but told us
 *   nothing" from "nothing answered".
 *
 * WHY GET-AND-CANCEL AND NOT HEAD
 *   The 6th Gen quote sheet is 1,307,626 bytes (measured: content-length on the
 *   live URL), so the body is exactly what this must not download. HEAD is the
 *   obvious answer and was the first implementation — GitHub Pages answers HEAD
 *   correctly, verified by curl.
 *
 *   It is still the wrong answer, because a preflight that a middlebox refuses
 *   is WORSE THAN NO PREFLIGHT: a network that drops HEAD would make every
 *   working tool look `unreachable` and put a fallback card over it. Store
 *   wifi, hotel wifi and corporate proxies are exactly where this code runs and
 *   exactly where non-GET methods get eaten. (Measured in this container, whose
 *   egress proxy resets HEAD tunnels: every real URL came back `slow` or
 *   `unreachable` while the same URLs framed perfectly.)
 *
 *   So: a plain GET — the most ordinary request there is, and a CORS-simple one
 *   so no OPTIONS preflight is needed — with `response.body.cancel()` called
 *   the moment the headers are in. The status line and Content-Length arrive
 *   with the headers; cancelling aborts the transfer there. Measured against
 *   the live 1,307,626-byte quote sheet: see the figure recorded beside
 *   cancelBody() below.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE WILL NOT DO
 *   It will not call a working tool broken. Every verdict except `ok` that
 *   leads to a card is backed by either a status code the server itself sent or
 *   a network-level refusal of BOTH probes. A response with no CORS header on a
 *   host we have not verified is `unknown`, and `unknown` means "carry on and
 *   let the iframe try" — which is exactly what the code did before this file
 *   existed. Pre-empting a working tool into a fallback card would be a worse
 *   bug than the one being fixed, and the old comment in overlay.js §0 that
 *   says so is still right.

         Chromium's "Failed to fetch" is no more specific. The original code
         took that rejection plus an opaque success from the no-cors probe as
         proof of the origin-wide 404 page, and on a lossy link that pair is
         exactly what a WORKING tool produces a few percent of the time: probe

         The verdict was `gone`, the card said the page "is gone", and the

         So the cors probe is tried TWICE before the no-cors discriminator is

         (it is a property of the response, not the network); a dropped packet
         has to happen twice in a row to fool it. The retry waits 400 ms so it
         is not the same congested instant. Cost on a healthy tool: nothing —
         the first probe succeeds and this branch never runs. Verified in the
