 * Cook County Cooks — v4 "Alive"
 * assets/labels.js  ·  INK ON THE PAPER
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Jeff, twice, in his own words:
 *
 *   "On the prep station, I want to see what each hanging receipt has on it…
 *    I want people to see what the link represents so they would know what they
 *    are clicking, BUT I WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IT IS WRITTEN ON THE RECEIPT
 *    HANGING THERE."
 *
 * Eight objects in the photographs are blank paper: four recipe cards on the
 * prep station's ticket rail, two clipboards on the back-office hooks, the sheet
 * standing in the printer's output tray, and the printed card lying on the pass.
 * Each is already a `[data-tool]` hotspot. This module letters them.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES IT READ AS PRINT AND NOT AS A WEB LABEL ──────────────────────
 * 1. THE PLANE.  Every sheet was measured off the 2400x1340 plate as a quad
 *    (TL,TR,BR,BL in plate %) and the type is mapped onto it with a CSS affine
 *    solved from those four corners. Lines of type run parallel to the sheet's
 *    own printed rules, not to the viewport.
 * 2. THE INK COLOUR.  Not black, and not a token. Each sheet's own lit paper
 *    colour was sampled off the plate and the ink is that colour x 0.235 — the
 *    reflectance of a printed mark. A card in shadow therefore gets a lighter
 *    ink than a card under the lamp, automatically, because its paper is darker.
 * 3. THE LIGHT ACROSS IT.  A luminance ramp was fitted over each sheet (du/dv,
 *    in the sheet's own axes) and becomes a mask gradient: the ink fades where
 *    that sheet falls into shadow. The printer sheet loses 28% of its light left
 *    to right; the pass card loses 25% front to back; you can see both.
 * 4. THE SIZE.  Type is sized in `cqw` of the WRITING AREA, so it is a fraction
 *    of that piece of paper at every viewport and every point of the push-in —
 *    never a viewport-relative size floating over a photograph.
 * 5. THE LIGHTS.  Opacity rides --enter (the gate) and --bloom (the density),
 *    so the writing resolves out of the paper as the room finishes lighting.
 *    No second animation loop, no rAF, no timers.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT mix-blend-mode: multiply ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Multiply is the textbook way to sit ink IN paper, and it does nothing here.
 * MEASURED, not assumed: the prep station's first card was screenshotted with
 * and without `mix-blend-mode: multiply` on the ink, at 2x, mid-room. The two
 * images are identical — maximum channel difference 0 over the whole card.
 * Two independent reasons:
 *   · theme.css §06 puts `transform` on `.hotspots`, and §09 puts
 *     `opacity: var(--own)` on it as well. Either alone makes that layer an
 *     isolated stacking context, so a blend mode on a descendant NEVER sees
 *     `.plate-wrap` behind it — it composites against transparent black, which
 *     for `multiply` is a no-op. Hence the identical screenshots.
 *   · SPEC.md §06 forbids it anyway: "NO LAYER OVER THE PLATE MAY CARRY A BLEND
 *     MODE" — a blend mode forces the compositor to read the backdrop back every
 *     frame, and these eight elements sit on a layer that transforms on scroll.
 * The physical model in (2) + (3) is what buys the effect instead, and it is
 * free: a solid colour, one alpha, one mask gradient.
 *
 * ── NARROW VIEWPORTS: THE INK GOES WITH THE PAPER ───────────────────────────
 * theme.css §17 already removes the object hotspots below 900px and on any
 * viewport narrower than 8:7 — iPad portrait and every phone — because a 16:9
 * plate cover-cropped into a 3:4 frame throws away a third of its width and
 * shrinks what is left. The ink is a CHILD of those buttons, so it goes with
 * them, and that is the right answer rather than a limitation worked around:
 * the smallest of these sheets is 4.8% of the plate, which on a 390px phone is
 * 19 CSS PIXELS OF PAPER. There is no type size, no reflow and no zoom that
 * makes a tool's name legible on 19px of a photograph — putting one there
 * would be the "AI slop" the client already rejected once. What the client
 * actually asked for on mobile is served by the layout that replaces it: the
 * rail's chip list becomes a full-width tap list of every tool in the room, at
 * 52px a row, and every row is the same name this module prints.
 *
 * One step up from that — a stage under ~1180px, where the hotspots are still
 * shown but the smallest writing area is down to ~70px — the ink drops its
 * furniture (kicker, "Tap to open", form rules) and gives the whole area back
 * to the tool's name. See §5's `@container stage` block.
 *
 * That decision is theme.css's to revisit, not this file's, and the hooks in §5
 * are what it should be revisited through: set `--ccc-label-show: 0` to take
 * ink off a breakpoint, or style `.hotspot--lettered` / `.ccc-ink` directly.
 * Nothing here fights a media query.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE MAY NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   · It must never build a second element over a lettered object. The ink is a
 *     CHILD of the existing hotspot button, so the click target, the reticle,
 *     the focus ring, the hover state and the 44px minimum are all untouched.
 *   · The ink is `aria-hidden`. `.hotspot-label` remains the accessible name and
 *     a screen reader hears the tool named exactly once.
 *   · It must never write --p / --plate-scale / --plate-x / --plate-y / --enter
 *     / --bloom. It only reads them.
 *   · Zero layout reads. Every number below is resolved by the compositor from
 *     percentages, `cqw`, and the plate's fixed 2400x1340 aspect.
 *
 * Plain ES module. No build step, no npm, no framework.

 * is the plate's own and therefore fixed at every viewport. That is the fact
 * this whole file rests on: a hotspot box has a CONSTANT pixel aspect ratio, so
 * an affine expressed as unitless matrix() terms plus a translate() in percent

 * 2 · THE SURFACES
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `quad`   TL, TR, BR, BL of the sheet, in PERCENT OF THE PLATE — the same
 *          coordinate space rooms.js uses, and measured the same way: a colour
 *          mask over plates/<room>.webp, then the four extreme corners of the
 *          component, checked against a 1%-grid overlay of the crop. TL/TR is
 *          the sheet's own TOP edge, so type set on it runs the way the sheet's
 *          pre-printed rules run.
 *
 * `zone`   [u0, v0, u1, v1] — the writing area inside that sheet, in the
 *          sheet's own fractions. This is the part that keeps the ink off the
 *          art: on the prep cards it lands inside the ruled field between the
 *          header rule and the last rule; on the pass card it lands on the
 *          card's own heading line; on the clipboards it is the top half of an
 *          otherwise blank form.
 *
 * `paper`  the sheet's LIT paper colour, sampled as the mean of the top 40% of
 *          a 17x17 grid inside the quad (the top 40% so pre-printed marks and
 *          the shadowed edge do not drag it down). The ink colour is derived
 *          from it — see §3.
 *
 * `ramp`   [du, dv] — d(luminance)/d(u) and /d(v) across the sheet, RELATIVE to
 *          the sheet's own mean luminance, from a least-squares plane fit over
 *          the same grid. Negative du = the sheet darkens to the right.
 *
 * `lines`  the tool's name, broken by hand. Two short lines beat one long one
 *          on a card 150px wide.
 * `rules`  the pitch, in em of the title, of faint pre-printed form rules drawn
 *          UNDER the block — for the two clipboards only. Their sheets are
 *          blank stock in the photograph and a bare title on blank stock reads
 *          as a sticker someone put there. The prep cards need none: the plate
 *          already prints six ruled lines on each of them and the type sits in
 *          among those.

 * A printed mark is not a colour, it is a reflectance: the same paper, returning

 * on the office's cool white stock (54,54,57), and warmest of all on the pass
 * card under the brass downlights (64,56,49). None of them is black, none of
 * them came from a palette, and a card in shadow gets a lighter ink than a card
 * under the lamp without a single hand-tuned number.
 *
 * 0.255 is about a laser toner's reflectance on office stock, and it was moved

 * Fit the plane.
 *
 * ── THE SOURCE RECTANGLE IS THE SHEET, UNFOLDED ────────────────────────────
 * The obvious construction — lay the element over the quad's bounding box and
 * warp — is wrong for exactly the reason this module exists. The pass card's
 * quad is raked 35°, so its bounding box is half again as wide as the card and
 * the type laid out inside it comes out squashed by the shear on the way onto
 * the paper. Instead the element is built at the sheet's OWN dimensions: as
 * wide as its top edge really is and as tall as its left edge really is, both
 * measured in the plate, both converted to hotspot-box percentages. The affine
 * is then a rotation and a shear with unit scale, so a cap set at 14cqw is 14%
 * of that sheet's width on the paper — at any viewport, at any point of the
 * push-in, on any of the eight surfaces.
 *
 * ── WHY AFFINE AND NOT A HOMOGRAPHY ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four corners, six degrees of freedom, so this is the least-squares affine
 * over the unit square rather than an exact fit. Deliberate. An exact fit needs
 * a projective homography solved against MEASURED PIXELS — overlay.js does that
 * for the three TV screens and pays a getBoundingClientRect per screen on mount
 * and on every resize. These eight sheets do not earn it: the worst keystone
 * among them is the pass card, whose near edge is 14% longer than its far edge,
 * and across the ~50px a line of type actually occupies the residual is under a
 * pixel. The affine buys the whole effect — rotation, shear, taper direction —
 * for zero layout reads and zero resize work.
 *
 * The normal equations for the design matrix [(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)] invert to
 * a constant, so the solve is three vector adds. With S the sum of the four
 * target corners:

 *     a = e1 + e2 - S/2

/* ── THE SETTING, DECLARED ONCE ────────────────────────────────────────────
   These four numbers describe what a line of this type actually occupies, and
   §5 INTERPOLATES the first three into the stylesheet rather than repeating
   them. That is the fix for the defect this section carried: the solve below
   fitted the glyph ADVANCES to 100% of the writing area, and §5 then added
   0.015em of tracking to every character, 0.08em to every space and a 0.02em
   blur to the whole run — none of which the estimate knew about. The longest
   line therefore came out 2–4% wider than the sheet it had been solved for, and
   `.ccc-ink` is `overflow: hidden`, so the last glyph was sheared off: EXCEPTIO
   REPORT on the left clipboard, PRINT OU on the printer sheet. An estimator that
   does not measure its own output's tracking is not an estimator.

   CHAR_EM   mean advance of an uppercase character, Archivo wdth 78 / wght 700,
             calibrated in the browser against all eight sheets.
   TRACK_EM  §5's letter-spacing. Paid once per character, INCLUDING the last.
   WORD_EM   §5's word-spacing. Paid once per space.
   BLUR_EM   §5's `filter: blur(0.02em)` spreads the final stroke past the
             advance width; the clip edge does not care that it is soft. */

 *
 * CLASS HOOKS FOR THE CSS AGENT — this is the contract, please style through it

 *
 *   .hotspot--lettered        the hotspot button, marked. Nothing else changes
 *                             about it; the reticle, dot, label and 44px floor
 *                             are all still theme.css §09's.
 *   .ccc-ink                  the sheet plane. Carries the transform and IS the
 *                             container the type is sized against. Do not put a
 *                             second transform on it — compose with --lbl-*.
 *   .ccc-ink__sheet           the flow box; carries the light mask.
 *   .ccc-ink__kicker          the small pre-printed word above the title.
 *   .ccc-ink__title           the tool's name.
 *   .ccc-ink__line            one line of it.
 *   .ccc-ink__rule            the ink rule under the title.
 *   .ccc-ink__meta            "Tap to open".

                     declares on .stage for the chips, the hotspot layer and
                     the screen band, so ink and object appear together by
                     construction rather than by two formulas agreeing. Its own
                     copy of that window used to open at --enter 0.58 and not
                     finish until 0.78, which put the writing on the paper
                     LATER than the paper itself; --cut settles the pair.
       --lbl-light   the density. --bloom is the engine's lights-come-up ramp
                     (easeOutQuint over the first 55% of the room's scrub), so
                     the writing starts at 82% and darkens to full as the room
                     finishes lighting. That is the beat: the paper brightens,
                     and what is written on it resolves out of it. The floor
                     was 70%, which was a legibility cost paid for a beat you
                     cannot see: the ink is already paper-colour x 0.235, and
                     the whole point of the label is that it can be READ before
                     the lights are up.

     ⚠ NO NESTED calc() INSIDE THE clamp(). Written with the middle argument
