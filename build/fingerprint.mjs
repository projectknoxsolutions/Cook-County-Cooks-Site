 * Cook County Cooks — build/fingerprint.mjs
 * CONTENT-HASHED ASSET FILENAMES
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO KILL
 *   New HTML and CSS composited over stale cached IMAGES from a previous build:
 *   every hotspot lands beside its object instead of on it, because the plate
 *   under the percentages is last week's. The plates are served with
 *   `cache-control: max-age=14400`, so for four hours after any art update every
 *   employee in the district can be looking at a different mixture of old and
 *   new. No amount of "hard refresh" instruction survives contact with a store.
 *
 * THE FIX
 *   Make a changed file a changed URL. Every plate, every module, the stylesheet
 *   and the door sound get the first ten hex digits of the SHA-256 of their own
 *   final bytes folded into the filename:
 *
 *       plates/office.webp        ->  plates/office.4d1f0a9c33.webp
 *       plates/office@1400.webp   ->  plates/office@1400.7be2c05118.webp
 *       assets/app.js             ->  assets/app.9f2c81e4a0.js
 *       assets/theme.css          ->  assets/theme.b30ac7d915.css
 *
 *   A four-hour cache on a URL that only ever holds one version of one file is
 *   not a hazard, it is the ideal. Nothing has to be revalidated and nothing can
 *   go stale: the HTML is the only document whose URL does not move, and the
 *   HTML is the thing that names all the new URLs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 *   Not a bundler and not a serve-time step. It runs HERE, its output is
 *   committed, and the deployed tree stays plain static files. Nothing about the
 *   shipped page changes: same ES modules, same relative paths, no npm.
 *
 * THE SOURCE FILENAMES STAY. `plates/office.webp` is still there, still named
 *   for a human, and still what you edit. The hashed file is a COPY beside it.
 *   That is deliberate on a live site: the un-hashed URLs are already in the
 *   wild (the og:image, printed handouts, whatever a manager bookmarked), and a
 *   reference this script fails to rewrite must degrade to "correct but
 *   uncached", never to a 404.
 *
 * HOW THE REWRITE WORKS — and why it is safe
 *   One pass of longest-key-first literal substitution over every text file that
 *   can name an asset. A key is a repo-relative path ("plates/office.webp"); an
 *   occurrence is rewritten in place, keeping whatever "../" prefix it was
 *   written with, so `../assets/theme.css` inside tools/printouts/index.html
 *   works the same as `assets/theme.css` inside index.html. Longest-first is
 *   what stops "plates/hero.webp" from eating the front of
 *   "plates/hero@1400.webp" — the @-suffixed key is matched first.
 *
 *   Because the keys are LOCAL paths, no absolute URL to another origin can
 *   match one. screens.js's two live feeds —
 *   raw.githubusercontent.com/.../promo-card.jpg and
 *   .../nps-detractor-streaks.json — are checked explicitly at the end of the
 *   run and the build FAILS if either has been touched.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS, so the run is staged:
 *   1. leaves            plates, the mp3, brand art, data JSON — nothing inside
 *                        them names another asset, so they hash immediately.
 *   2. CSS               theme.css names dark plates in an image-set(). Rewrite
 *                        those first, THEN hash the rewritten bytes.
 *   3. JS, in dependency order   a module's hash depends on its own imports'
 *                        hashes, so rooms.js is hashed before labels.js, which
 *                        is hashed before app.js. Import specifiers and asset
 *                        literals are both rewritten before hashing.
 *   4. HTML              rewritten in place, never hashed — it is the one URL
 *                        the browser has to re-check, and GitHub Pages already
 *                        serves it with a short cache.
 *
 * assets/theme.css IS OWNED BY ANOTHER AGENT. This script never hand-edits it —
 *   it reads it, rewrites the url() references mechanically into a hashed COPY,
 *   and leaves the source file byte-for-byte alone. Re-run the build after any
 *   theme.css edit and the copy catches up. Nobody has to type a hash.
 *
 * ONE PREVIOUS GENERATION IS KEPT ON PURPOSE — see §6. index.html is served
 *   with `cache-control: max-age=600`, so for up to ten minutes after a push a
 *   rep returning to a bookmark is holding the PREVIOUS index.html and asking
 *   for the PREVIOUS hashes. Deleting them the moment the new ones exist made
 *   every deploy a ten-minute window in which a 404'd module was a blank page.
 *
 * EVERY EMITTED MODULE'S IMPORTS ARE RESOLVED BEFORE THE BUILD IS ALLOWED TO
 *   EXIT — see §5b. A rewrite this script silently misses is the one way it can
 *   ship a page that 404s while printing a confident "entry:" line.
 *
 * Usage:  node build/fingerprint.mjs [--clean]
 *         --clean  removes every previously-emitted *.<hash>.* file first —
 *                  BOTH generations — and starts the retention window over.
 *                  Use it to reset, never as part of a deploy: a --clean build
 *                  is precisely the blank-page window §6 exists to close.

/* ── 5b · every emitted module's imports must actually resolve ────────────── *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *   IMPORT_RE (§3) is anchored `^[ \t]*` under /gm, deliberately: it stops a
 *   module's own doc comment ("import { initChefWall } from './chefwall.js';"
 *   as a usage example) from reading as a self-import and therefore as a
 *   dependency cycle. The cost of that anchor is that an import which does not
 *   BEGIN its own line is invisible to this script:
 *
 *       const m = await import('./screens.js');      // assignment, mid-line
 *       if (needsPocket) { await import('./pocket.js'); }   // nested in a block
 *
 *   Such a specifier is never rewritten. The build then exits 0 and prints a
 *   confident "entry:" line while the emitted module still names an un-hashed
 *   twin — and after §6 has pruned two generations of it, or if the specifier
 *   was left hashed at an old hash, that is a 404 on a module, which is a blank
 *   page. The tree was clean when this was written (2026-08-31: 16 modules, 20
 *   relative specifiers, all resolved), so this is a latch, not a repair.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, on the BYTES THAT SHIP rather than on the sources:
 *   1. every relative specifier resolves to a file that exists on disk;
 *   2. no relative specifier still points at a file this build fingerprints —
 *      i.e. at an UN-hashed twin. That is the rewrite-miss above, and it is the
 *      check that catches it, because the un-hashed source is still on disk (it
 *      is deliberately kept, see "THE SOURCE FILENAMES STAY") and so check 1
 *      alone would pass straight over it.
 *

/* ── 6 · prune, KEEPING ONE PREVIOUS GENERATION ───────────────────────────── *
 * THE BUG THIS NOW EXISTS TO KILL.
 *   This step used to keep exactly one hashed copy per source and delete
 *   everything else — the previous build's files included. But index.html is
 *   the one URL that does not move, and GitHub Pages serves it with
 *   `cache-control: max-age=600`. So for up to TEN MINUTES after every push, a
 *   rep coming back to a bookmark is holding the PREVIOUS index.html, which
 *   names the PREVIOUS hashes, which this step had just deleted. Measured on
 *   the live site 2026-08-31: assets/app.2d8d16ff8f.js, assets/theme.f4c9abadeb.css
 *   and data/tools.46eb63be76.json all 404'd — and a 404 on the entry module is
 *   a blank page, not a degraded one. Every deploy opened that window.
 *
 * THE FIX, AND WHY IT CANNOT GROW.
 *   Prune N-2, not N-1. Two generations of hashed files are on disk at any
 *   time: the one this build just emitted and the one before it. A cached
 *   index.html is at most one generation old (it expires in ten minutes; the
 *   next build is minutes-to-days later), so it always resolves.
 *
 *   The retained set is not guessed from the filesystem — it is READ FROM
 *   build/asset-generations.json, which this step writes and which is committed
 *   with the build. Two entries, newest first, hard-capped at KEEP_GENERATIONS.
 *   A file leaves the repo on the SECOND build after the one that emitted it:
 *   generation 1 is kept by build 2 and deleted by build 3. So the ceiling is
 *   two hashed copies per source file, forever — the working tree cannot
 *   accumulate, which is what the original one-copy rule was protecting.
 *
 *   A build that changes nothing emits the identical file list. That must NOT
 *   count as a new generation, or two no-op builds in a row would push the real
 *   previous generation out and reopen the window. So an unchanged list leaves
 *   the manifest alone — no rewrite, no git churn.
 *
 *   `--clean` wipes both generations and starts the window over. It is a reset,
 *   not a deploy step; see the header.
