 * Cook County Cooks — build/sync-inline-tools.mjs
 *
 * index.html carries an inline copy of data/tools.json on window.__CCC_INLINE__
 * so the page boots over file:// — a fetch() to a file:// URL is CORS-blocked,
 * and Jeff and the district managers review builds straight off a USB stick.
 *
 * app.js PREFERS that inline copy over the network fetch. So when the two drift,
 * the site silently renders the STALE one and every symptom points somewhere
 * else. It has now bitten twice: most recently when two tools swapped rooms and
 * the rail, the ink labels and the C³ menu all kept showing the old assignment
 * while data/tools.json was already correct.
 *
 * This step rewrites the inline block from the file on every build. Nobody
 * hand-edits it, and the two cannot diverge.
 *
 * IT ALSO REWRITES THE <noscript> INDEX, for exactly the same reason.
 *   The <noscript> block at the foot of index.html is the plain-links floor: it
 *   is what a rep gets when JavaScript is off AND — since app.js grew its
 *   module-failure fallback — when a module fails to load at all. It was
 *   hand-maintained, and on 2026-08-31 it had drifted to 23 links against 24 in
 *   tools.json: `rep-hourly-rate` and `training-pos` were MISSING, four tools
 *   were filed under the wrong room, and a dead `tools/employee-of-week` link
 *   was still there. A drifted floor is a rep who cannot reach a tool on the one
 *   occasion the pretty version already failed them.
 *
 *   So it is generated here from the SAME parsed tools.json, grouped by the SAME
 *   ROOM_ORDER the cinema and the pocket list walk. The markup and the copy
 *   around it are reproduced exactly as they were written, so the diff on any
 *   future run is data and nothing else.

 * THE <noscript> INDEX — REGENERATED, NOT HAND-MAINTAINED.
 *
 * WHAT IS REGENERATED AND WHAT IS NOT.
 *   Only the run of `<h3>room</h3><ul>…links…</ul>` blocks is rewritten: from
 *   the FIRST <h3> inside the <noscript> to the LAST </ul>. The heading, the
 *   "needs JavaScript" sentence above it and the Walk-In sentence below it are
 *   prose, they are not derived from anything, and they are left byte-for-byte
 *   alone. The generated span is the part that can drift, and it is the only
 *   part this touches.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS ROOM_ORDER, read from assets/roomorder.js — the single
 *   definition the cinema and the pocket list both walk (rooms.js re-exports
 *   it). Rooms that appear in tools.json but not in ROOM_ORDER are appended,
 *   which is exactly what pocket.js does, so a new room cannot silently fall
 *   off the plain-links floor either.
 *
 *   That is a file in this repo, not a tool on a machine, so it cannot rot the
 *   way the workflow's ImageMagick precondition did. But if it ever cannot be
 *   read, this falls back to the order the rooms are written in tools.json
 *   (identical today) and warns, rather than failing a build over a list order.
 *
 * THE WALK-IN IS NOT IN HERE, and that is load-bearing. The 14 manager tools
 *   live encrypted in data/freezer.sealed.json and are never in tools.json;
 *   the `freezer` room is skipped explicitly as well, so a manager tool that
 *   ever did land in tools.json by mistake still could not leak into a block
 *   that is served to everybody in plain text.
